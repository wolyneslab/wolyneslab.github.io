    abstract = {We present OpenAWSEM and Open3SPN2, new cross-compatible implementations of coarse-grained models for protein (AWSEM) and DNA (3SPN2) molecular dynamics simulations within the OpenMM framework. These new implementations retain the chemical accuracy and intrinsic efficiency of the original models while adding GPU acceleration and the ease of forcefield modification provided by OpenMMâs Custom Forces software framework. By utilizing GPUs, we achieve around a 30-fold speedup in protein and protein-DNA simulations over the existing LAMMPS-based implementations running on a single CPU core. We showcase the benefits of OpenMMâs Custom Forces framework by devising and implementing two new potentials that allow us to address important aspects of protein folding and structure prediction and by testing the ability of the combined OpenAWSEM and Open3SPN2 to model protein-DNA binding. The first potential is used to describe the changes in effective interactions that occur as a protein becomes partially buried in a membrane. We also introduced an interaction to describe proteins with multiple disulfide bonds. Using simple pairwise disulfide bonding terms results in unphysical clustering of cysteine residues, posing a problem when simulating the folding of proteins with many cysteines. We now can computationally reproduce Anfinsenâs early Nobel prize winning experiments by using OpenMMâs Custom Forces framework to introduce a multi-body disulfide bonding term that prevents unphysical clustering. Our protein-DNA simulations show that the binding landscape is funneled towards structures that are quite similar to those found using experiments. In summary, this paper provides a simulation tool for the molecular biophysics community that is both easy to use and sufficiently efficient to simulate large proteins and large protein-DNA systems that are central to many cellular processes. These codes should facilitate the interplay between molecular simulations and cellular studies, which have been hampered by the large mismatch between the time and length scales accessible to molecular simulations and those relevant to cell biology.},

	Abstract = { The associative memory, water-mediated, structure and energy model (AWSEM) has been successfully used to study protein folding, binding, and aggregation problems. In this work, we introduce AWSEM-IDP, a new AWSEM branch for simulating intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), where the weights of the potentials determining secondary structure formation have been finely tuned, and a novel potential is introduced that helps to precisely control both the average extent of protein chain collapse and the chain's fluctuations in size. AWSEM-IDP can efficiently sample large conformational spaces, while retaining sufficient molecular accuracy to realistically model proteins. We applied this new model to two IDPs, demonstrating that AWSEM-IDP can reasonably well reproduce higher-resolution reference data, thus providing the foundation for a transferable IDP force field. Finally, we used thermodynamic perturbation theory to show that, in general, the conformational ensembles of IDPs are highly sensitive to fine-tuning of force field parameters. },

	Abstract = { Many unrelated proteins and peptides have been found spontaneously to form amyloid fibers above a critical concentration. Even for a single sequence, however, the amyloid fold is not a single well-defined structure. Although the cross-β hydrogen bonding pattern is common to all amyloids, all other aspects of amyloid fiber structures are sensitive to both the sequence of the aggregating peptides and the solvent conditions under which the aggregation occurs. Amyloid fibers are easy to identify and grossly characterize using microscopy, but their insolubility and aperiodicity along the dimensions transverse to the fiber axis have complicated detailed experimental structural characterization. In this paper, we explore the landscape of possibilities for amyloid protofilament structures that are made up of a single stack of peptides associated in a parallel in-register manner. We view this landscape as a two-dimensional version of the usual three-dimensional protein folding problem: the survey of the two-dimensional folds of protein ribbons. Adopting this view leads to a practical method of predicting stable protofilament structures of arbitrary sequences. We apply this scheme to variants of Aβ, the amyloid forming peptide that is characteristically associated with Alzheimer's disease. Consistent with what is known from experiment, we find that Aβ protofibrils are polymorphic. To our surprise, however, the ribbon-folding landscape of Aβ turned out to be strikingly simple. We confirm that, at the level of the monomeric protofilament, the landscape for the Aβ sequence is reasonably well funneled toward structures that are similar to those that have been determined by experiment. The landscape has more distinct minima than does a typical globular protein landscape but fewer and deeper minima than the landscape of a randomly shuffled sequence having the same overall composition. It is tempting to consider the possibility that the significant degree of funneling of Aβ's ribbon-folding landscape has arisen as a result of natural selection. More likely, however, the intermediate complexity of Aβ's ribbon-folding landscape has come from the post facto selection of the Aβ sequence as an object of study by researchers because only by having a landscape with some degree of funneling can ordered aggregation of such a peptide occur at in vivo concentrations. In addition to predicting polymorph structures, we show that predicted solubilities of polymorphs correlate with experiment and with their elongation free energies computed by coarse-grained molecular dynamics. },

	Abstract = { The nucleation of protein aggregates and their growth are important in determining the structure of the cell's membraneless organelles as well as the pathogenesis of many diseases. The large number of molecular types of such aggregates along with the intrinsically stochastic nature of aggregation challenges our theoretical and computational abilities. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation using the Gillespie algorithm is a powerful tool for modeling stochastic kinetics, but it is computationally demanding when a large number of diverse species is involved. To explore the mechanisms and statistics of aggregation more efficiently, we introduce a new approach to model stochastic aggregation kinetics which introduces noise into already statistically averaged equations obtained using mathematical moment closure schemes. Stochastic moment equations summarize succinctly the dynamics of the large diversity of species with different molecularity involved in aggregation but still take into account the stochastic fluctuations that accompany not only primary and secondary nucleation but also aggregate elongation, dissociation, and fragmentation. This method of ``second stochasticization'' works well where the fluctuations are modest in magnitude as is often encountered in vivo where the number of protein copies in some computations can be in the hundreds to thousands. Simulations using second stochasticization reveal a scaling law that correlates the size of the fluctuations in aggregate size and number with the total number of monomers. This scaling law is confirmed using experimental data. We believe second stochasticization schemes will prove valuable for bridging the gap between in vivo cell biology and detailed modeling.

	Abstract = { Disordered proteins frequently serve as interaction hubs involving a constrained variety of partners. Complexes with different partners frequently exhibit distinct binding modes, involving regions that remain disordered in the bound state. While the conformational properties of disordered proteins are well-characterized in their free states, less is known about the molecular mechanisms by which specificity can be achieved not with one but with multiple partners. Using the energy landscape theory concept of protein frustration, we demonstrate that complexes of disordered proteins exhibit a high degree of local frustration, especically at the binding interface. These suboptimal interactions lead to the possibility of multiple bound substates, each displaying distinct frustration patterns, which are differently populated in complexes with different partners. These results explain how specificity of disordered proteins can be achieved without a single common bound conformation and how the confliict between different interactions can be used to control the binding to multiple partners. },

	Abstract = { ConspectusAre all protein interactions fully optimized? Do suboptimal interactions compromise specificity? What is the functional impact of frustration? Why does evolution not optimize some contacts? Proteins and their complexes are best described as ensembles of states populating an energy landscape. These ensembles vary in breadth from narrow ensembles clustered around a single average X-ray structure to broader ensembles encompassing a few different functional ``taxonomic'' states on to near continua of rapidly interconverting conformations, which are called ``fuzzy'' or even ``intrinsically disordered''. Here we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for confronting the structural and dynamical continuum of protein assemblies by combining the concepts of energetic frustration and interaction fuzziness. The diversity of the protein structural ensemble arises from the frustrated conflicts between the interactions that create the energy landscape. When frustration is minimal after folding, it results in a narrow ensemble, but residual frustrated interactions result in fuzzy ensembles, and this fuzziness allows a versatile repertoire of biological interactions. Here we discuss how fuzziness and frustration play off each other as proteins fold and assemble, viewing their significance from energetic, functional, and evolutionary perspectives.We demonstrate, in particular, that the common physical origin of both concepts is related to the ruggedness of the energy landscapes, intramolecular in the case of frustration and intermolecular in the case of fuzziness. Within this framework, we show that alternative sets of suboptimal contacts may encode specificity without achieving a single structural optimum. Thus, we demonstrate that structured complexes may not be optimized, and energetic frustration is realized via different sets of contacts leading to multiplicity of specific complexes. Furthermore, we propose that these suboptimal, frustrated, or fuzzy interactions are under evolutionary selection and expand the biological repertoire by providing a multiplicity of biological activities. In accord, we show that non-native interactions in folding or interaction landscapes can cooperate to generate diverse functional states, which are essential to facilitate adaptation to different cellular conditions. Thus, we propose that not fully optimized structures may actually be beneficial for biological activities of proteins via an alternative set of suboptimal interactions. The importance of such variability has not been recognized across different areas of biology.This account provides a modern view on folding, function, and assembly across the protein universe. The physical framework presented here is applicable to the structure and dynamics continuum of proteins and opens up new perspectives for drug design involving not fully structured, highly dynamic protein assemblies. },

	Abstract = { We discuss the photon activation of structural relaxations in glassy melts and frozen glasses containing molecules that can photoisomerize. The built-in stress following a photoinduced electronic transition lowers the thermal activation barrier for subsequent structural reconfiguration of the glassy matrix. We provide explicit predictions for the barrier distribution and structural relaxation spectrum as functions of the concentration of photoactivated molecules and the fragility of the material. The typical barrier decreases upon photoactivation, while the barrier distribution increases in width with increasing mole fraction of photoactive molecules and fluence, and becomes multimodal. In a frozen glass, the initial effects of photoisomerization locally facilitate the dynamics near the excited chromophores and can lead to complete fluidization at a sufficiently high fluence. Photon activation initially decreases the yield strength of the glass. Depending on the precise time course of illumination, there however emerges a spatial coexistence of softened regions with regions that, after being destabilized by illumination, have reconfigured so that they are now made of ultrastable glass or have crystallized as in a porcelain. This sequence of events, after illumination, can lead to highly stable amorphous solids, potentially approaching the Kauzmann limit. These mechanisms are at the root of optical information storage technologies in amorphous materials. },

	Abstract = { Recent advances in machine learning, bioinformatics, and the understanding of the folding problem have enabled efficient predictions of protein structures with moderate accuracy, even for targets where there is little information from templates. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations provide a route to refine such predicted structures, but unguided atomistic simulations, even when lengthy in time, often fail to eliminate incorrect structural features that would prevent the structure from becoming more energetically favorable owing to the necessity of making large scale motions and to overcoming energy barriers for side chain repacking. In this study, we show that localizing packing frustration at atomic resolution by examining the statistics of the energetic changes that occur when the local environment of a site is changed allows one to identify the most likely locations of incorrect contacts. The global statistics of atomic resolution frustration in structures that have been predicted using various algorithms provide strong indicators of structural quality when tested over a database of 20 targets from previous CASP experiments. Residues that are more correctly located turn out to be more minimally frustrated than more poorly positioned sites. These observations provide a diagnosis of both global and local quality of predicted structures and thus can be used as guidance in all-atom refinement simulations of the 20 targets. Refinement simulations guided by atomic packing frustration turn out to be quite efficient and significantly improve the quality of the structures. },

	Abstract = {Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a promising gene therapy vector because of its efficient gene delivery and relatively mild immunogenicity. To improve delivery target specificity, researchers use combinatorial and rational library design strategies to generate novel AAV capsid variants. These approaches frequently propose high proportions of nonforming or noninfective capsid protein sequences that reduce the effective depth of synthesized vector DNA libraries, thereby raising the discovery cost of novel vectors. We evaluated two computational techniques for their ability to estimate the impact of residue mutations on AAV capsid protein-protein interactions and thus predict changes in vector fitness, reasoning that these approaches might inform the design of functionally enriched AAV libraries and accelerate therapeutic candidate identification. The Frustratometer computes an energy function derived from the energy landscape theory of protein folding. Direct-coupling analysis (DCA) is a statistical framework that captures residue coevolution within proteins. We applied the Frustratometer to select candidate protein residues predicted to favor assembled or disassembled capsid states, then predicted mutation effects at these sites using the Frustratometer and DCA. Capsid mutants were experimentally assessed for changes in virus formation, stability, and transduction ability. The Frustratometer-based metric showed a counterintuitive correlation with viral stability, whereas a DCA-derived metric was highly correlated with virus transduction ability in the small population of residues studied. Our results suggest that coevolutionary models may be able to elucidate complex capsid residue-residue interaction networks essential for viral function, but further study is needed to understand the relationship between protein energy simulations and viral capsid metastability.},

	Abstract = {To function, biomolecules require sufficient specificity of interaction as well as stability to live in the cell while still being able to move. Thermodynamic stability of only a limited number of specific structures is important so as to prevent promiscuous interactions. The individual interactions in proteins, therefore, have evolved collectively to give funneled minimally frustrated landscapes but some strategic parts of biomolecular sequences located at specific sites in the structure have been selected to be frustrated in order to allow both motion and interaction with partners. We describe a framework efficiently to quantify and localize biomolecular frustration at atomic resolution by examining the statistics of the energy changes that occur when the local environment of a site is changed. The location of patches of highly frustrated interactions correlates with key biological locations needed for physiological function. At atomic resolution, it becomes possible to extend frustration analysis to protein-ligand complexes. At this resolution one sees that drug specificity is correlated with there being a minimally frustrated binding pocket leading to a funneled binding landscape. Atomistic frustration analysis provides a route for screening for more specific compounds for drug discovery.},

	Abstract = {Using computer simulations, we generate cell-specific 3D chromosomal structures and compare them to recently published chromatin structures obtained through microscopy. We demonstrate using machine learning and polymer physics simulations that epigenetic information can be used to predict the structural ensembles of multiple human cell lines. Theory predicts that chromosome structures are fluid and can only be described by an ensemble, which is consistent with the observation that chromosomes exhibit no unique fold. Nevertheless, our analysis of both structures from simulation and microscopy reveals that short segments of chromatin make two-state transitions between closed conformations and open dumbbell conformations. Finally, we study the conformational changes associated with the switching of genomic compartments observed in human cell lines. The formation of genomic compartments resembles hydrophobic collapse in protein folding, with the aggregation of denser and predominantly inactive chromatin driving the positioning of active chromatin toward the surface of individual chromosomal territories.},

	Abstract = {The phase problem in X-ray crystallography arises from the fact that only the intensities, and not the phases, of the diffracting electromagnetic waves are measured directly. Molecular replacement can often estimate the relative phases of reflections starting with those derived from a template structure, which is usually a previously solved structure of a similar protein. The key factor in the success of molecular replacement is finding a good template structure. When no good solved template exists, predicted structures based partially on templates can sometimes be used to generate models for molecular replacement, thereby extending the lower bound of structural and sequence similarity required for successful structure determination. Here, the effectiveness is examined of structures predicted by a state-of-the-art prediction algorithm, the {\it Associative memory, Water-mediated, Structure and Energy Model Suite} ({\it AWSEM-Suite}), which has been shown to perform well in predicting protein structures in CASP13 when there is no significant sequence similarity to a solved protein or only very low sequence similarity to known templates. The performance of {\it AWSEM-Suite} structures in molecular replacement is discussed and the results show that {\it AWSEM-Suite} performs well in providing useful phase information, often performing better than {\it I-TASSER-MR} and the previous algorithm {\it AWSEM-Template}.},

	Abstract = {The growth and stabilization of dendritic spines is thought to be essential for strengthening the connections between neurons and thereby memories. Actin cytoskeleton remodeling in spines is the basis of this growth and stabilization. A functional prion that binds mRNA, CPEB3, which interacts with actin, has been reported to be involved in the maintenance of long-term memory by forming stable aggregates. Here we study the interaction between actin and CPEB3 and propose a molecular model for the complex structure of CPEB3 bound to an actin filament. Our model gives insights into the actin/CPEB3 positive feedback loop underlying long-term memory which involves CPEB3{\textquoteright}s binding to actin, its aggregation, and its regulation by SUMOylation.Dendritic spines are tiny membranous protrusions on the dendrites of neurons. Dendritic spines change shape in response to input signals, thereby strengthening the connections between neurons. The growth and stabilization of dendritic spines is thought to be essential for maintaining long-term memory. Actin cytoskeleton remodeling in spines is a key element of their formation and growth. More speculatively, the aggregation of CPEB3, a functional prion that binds RNA, has been reported to be involved in the maintenance of long-term memory. Here we study the interaction between actin and CPEB3 and propose a molecular model for the complex structure of CPEB3 and an actin filament (F-actin). The results of our computational modeling, including both energetic and structural analyses, are compared with novel data from peptide array experiments. Our model of the CPEB3/F-actin interaction suggests that F-actin potentially triggers the aggregation-prone structural transition of a short CPEB3 sequence by zipping it into a beta-hairpin form. We also propose that the CPEB3/F-actin interaction might be regulated by the SUMOylation of CPEB3, based on bioinformatic searches for potential SUMOylation sites as well as SUMO interacting motifs in CPEB3. On the basis of these results and the existing literature, we put forward a possible molecular mechanism underlying long-term memory that involves CPEB3{\textquoteright}s binding to actin, its aggregation, and its regulation by SUMOylation.Raw data, input files for simulations, and analysis scripts have been deposited in Xinyu-Gu/CPEB3_Actin at Zenodo, https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/274487374, and GitHub, https://github.com/Xinyu-Gu/CPEB3_Actin) (39).},

	abstract = {Networks of actin filaments form the structural scaffold of cells. Energy-consuming protein motors such as the myosins that exert forces on the network by {\textquotedblleft}walking{\textquotedblright} on actin filaments as well as polymerization of actin polymers are necessary for the movement, growth, and division of cells. The dynamics of actomyosin networks is regulated by actin-binding proteins. One of the most important of these binding proteins is the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex that nucleates branched filaments, thereby altering network topology. In this work, we simulated the dynamics of actomyosin networks both with and without Arp2/3 complexes. The branched networks with Arp2/3 exhibit rare convulsive movements, which we call {\textquotedblleft}avalanches,{\textquotedblright} that are reminiscent of recent experimental reports of {\textquotedblleft}cytoquakes.{\textquotedblright}Actomyosin networks give cells the ability to move and divide. These networks contract and expand while being driven by active energy-consuming processes such as motor protein walking and actin polymerization. Actin dynamics is also regulated by actin-binding proteins, such as the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex. This complex generates branched filaments, thereby changing the overall organization of the network. In this work, the spatiotemporal patterns of dynamical actin assembly accompanying the branching-induced reorganization caused by Arp2/3 were studied using a computational model (mechanochemical dynamics of active networks [MEDYAN]); this model simulates actomyosin network dynamics as a result of chemical reactions whose rates are modulated by rapid mechanical equilibration. We show that branched actomyosin networks relax significantly more slowly than do unbranched networks. Also, branched networks undergo rare convulsive movements, {\textquotedblleft}avalanches,{\textquotedblright} that release strain in the network. These avalanches are associated with the more heterogeneous distribution of mechanically linked filaments displayed by branched networks. These far-from-equilibrium events arising from the marginal stability of growing actomyosin networks provide a possible mechanism of the {\textquotedblleft}cytoquakes{\textquotedblright} recently seen in experiments.},

 abstract = {<p>The binding of dioxygen and carbon monoxide to heme proteins such as myoglobin and hemoglobin has been studied with flash photolysis. At temperatures below 200 K, binding occurs from within the heme pocket and, contrary to expectation, with nearly equal rates for both ligands. This observation has led to a reexamination of the theory of the association reaction taking into account friction, protein structure, and the nature of electronic transitions. The rate coefficients for the limiting cases of large and small friction are found with simple arguments that use characteristic lengths and times. The arguments indicate how transition state theory as well as calculations based on nonadiabatic perturbation theory, which is called the Golden Rule, may fail. For ligand-binding reactions the data suggest the existence of intermediate states not directly observed so far. The general considerations may also apply to other biomolecular processes such as electron transport.</p>},

 abstract = {Recent static and dynamical work suggest a close analogy between spin glasses with discontinuous Edwards-Anderson order parameter and structural glasses. The mean-field dynamical spin-glass theory predicts freezing above the usual thermodynamic transition temperature. Here we use the approach of Thouless, Anderson, and Palmer for Potts glasses to show that the dynamical approach locates a thermodynamically metastable glassy state. We also give divergent correlation lengths as both the static and dynamical transition temperatures are approached. We argue that the static transition is analogous to an ideal glass transition temperature in the structural glass problem. We also argue that the static transition temperature can be identified as the temperature at which the configurational entropy vanishes, i.e., the Kauzmann temperature. Dynamical transitions between the metastable states are discussed. We argue that divergent lifetimes occur near the Kauzmann temperature.},

@article{1987Logan:uy,
 abstract = {A simple theory is developed to describe the interplay between Anderson localization and dephasing mechanisms (such as inelastic electron- or exciton-phonon coupling), within the framework of a tight-binding model of spatially disordered systems. Self-consistency is enforced by demanding that only the most probable value of the imaginary part of the site self-energy be self-consistently determined. Dephasing interactions are characterized simply by an energy-independent dephasing rate. When the dephasing rate vanishes the pure localization problem may be examined as the transition is approached from either the localized or the extended regimes; mobility-edge trajectories may thereby be located. In the limit of rapid dephasing the theory correlates with the usual master-equation treatments of incoherent transport. For sufficiently large disorder a nonmonotonic but continuous crossover from coherent to incoherent transport is in general predicted. The problem of Mooij correlation, viewed as a weak-delocalization phenomenon, is also examined: it is suggested that the correlation is not universal as has frequently been supposed.},

However in some respects biomolecules are at the borders of the domain of applicability of classical mechanics. The role of quantum mechanical effects in biomolecular structure and function is therefore worth investigating. Here we present preliminary results from a quantum simulation of a protein and contrast them with results from full classical simulations. The most significant differences are found in motions of high frequency, such as bond stretching or the torsional oscillation of groups that bear hydrogen atoms. The amplitudes of such motions are significantly increased by the penetration of atoms into classically forbidden regions. These differences will directly influence the rates of such processes as proton and electron transfer.},

The results are expressed in the form of simultaneous differential equations in terms of density operators and can treat strong system-bath interactions where the correlated effects of the noise play an important role. The classical Fokker-Planck equation for a Gaussian-Markovian noise is obtained by performing the Wigner transformation, and its equilibrium state is shown to be the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The method is convenient for numerical studies. Calculations for quantum-system harmonic oscillators and the double-well potential problems are demonstrated for cases of Gaussian-white noise and Gaussian-Markovian noise.},

 abstract = {The distribution of activation energies for ligand rebinding in conformational substates of sperm whale myoglobin is investigated with a molecular dynamics{\textminus}quenching method. The technique approximately locates transition states for curve crossing processes using an interpolating Hamiltonian as in Marcus's electron transfer theory. Linear free energy relations are examined. The transition from the dissociated state to the activated state involves a collective motion of the protein. The activation energy is correlated more to the extent of the collective motion of the protein than to the change of any single bond or bond angle. The predicted average structures of fast and slow rebinding substates which will soon be accessible to determination by cryogenic X-ray crystallography are compared. The CO geometry of the activated protein complex from the simulation agrees well with the structure of a low temperature photodissociated intermediate determined by Schlichting et al.},

The results of these generally applicable expressions are compared with large scale computation on energy flow in several organic molecules studied experimentally:  formaldehyde, thiophosgene, and propyne.

 abstract = {<p>The characterization of protein-folding kinetics with increasing chain length under various thermodynamic conditions is addressed using the capillarity picture in which distinct spatial regions of the protein are imagined to be folded or trapped and separated by interfaces. The quantitative capillarity theory is based on the nucleation theory of first-order transitions and the droplet analysis of glasses and random magnets. The concepts of folding funnels and rugged energy landscapes are shown to be applicable in the large size limit just as for smaller proteins. An ideal asymptotic free-energy profile as a function of a reaction coordinate measuring progress down the funnel is shown to be quite broad. This renders traditional transition state theory generally inapplicable but allows a diffusive picture with a transition-state region to be used. The analysis unifies several scaling arguments proposed earlier. The importance of fluctuational fine structure both to the free-energy profile and to the glassy dynamics is highlighted. The fluctuation effects lead to a very broad trapping-time distribution. Considerations necessary for understanding the crossover between the mean field and capillarity pictures of the energy landscapes are discussed.

 abstract = {Protein molecules generally fold into precise three-dimensional shapes. While of direct interest to biochemists, the question of how folding occurs has attracted the interest of a much broader audience of scientists ranging from the traditional chemical scientists to computer scientists and physicists. Also changing over time has been the very meaning of the question of protein folding. To the descriptive scientist it may be sufficient to assert that folding occurs on a time scale no slower than protein biosynthesis, and that the information required to find the precise three-dimensional shape is contained in the one-dimensional sequence. Although exceptions to these generalizations recently have begun to emerge; in the study of prion-associated diseases (1), they have sufficient generality to allow us to treat the folding process as a black box for transcribing one-dimensional information into three-dimensional structures. It is, however, necessary to probe deeper into the mechanism if the prediction of protein structure from sequence and the design of truly novel protein-like molecules are to be achieved. These goals are of great practical significance in biology and medicine. The question of the mechanism of folding was once thought to be entirely analogous to the question of mechanism in intermediary metabolism or classical organic chemistry. In those problems the small number of participating species and the relatively specific routes by which they interconvert owing to the large scale of covalent energy barriers compared with thermal energies means that a small number of fairly discrete chemical steps can be isolated. This is the classic notion of a protein folding pathway with a series of discrete intermediates. Such discrete intermediates do occur in the late stages of protein folding, and to a great extent, the chemical kinetic details of these interconversions have been catalogued (2). However, to answer the practical questions of structure prediction {\ldots}},

 abstract = {Charge transfer reactions in polar solvents are accompanied by reorganization of the solvent. In many cases, the dynamics of this reorganization determines the rate for charge transfer. In this paper the dynamics of this process is investigated with special emphasis on the molecular nature of the solvent. The reaction coordinate is identified and an equation of motion for this coordinate is derived. The equation describes the diffusion of the reaction coordinate in a bistable potential, which can be treated using Kramers{\textquoteright} theory. The form of the bistable potential is discussed in detail, with special emphasis on the distinction between this effective potential and a nonequilibrium free energy. As an example the resulting expressions for the rate of electron transfer between the charged and uncharged states of a zwitterion are calculated using a simple, approximate model for the fluid structure. The difference between these results and those from the continuum dielectric treatment of the solvent are discussed.},

@article{1998Chandler:1998gza,
 abstract = {From a discretization of the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, it is possible to relate equilibrium quantum many body theory to classical statistical mechanics. In this paper, we significantly extend and analyze this well known isomorphism in terms of the equilibrium theory of classical molecular fluids composed of flexible polyatomic species. We show how quantum influence functionals are isomorphic to classical cavity distribution functions. The former describe the influence of surrounding media on the dynamics of quantal degrees of freedom, and the latter describe environmental effects for classical models of flexible molecules and chemical equilibria. The connection allows the use of classical theories to perform nonperturbative calculations of influence functionals which treat the influence functionals and many body correlation functions in a self-consistent fashion. We illustrate the computational advantages of the method by studying its predictions for a hard sphere model of liquid helium above the l transition. The nature of quantum indistinguishability of identical particles (i.e., quantum exchange) is treated in our theory in terms of an exact isomorphism with chemical equilibria. This connection allows the treatment of exchange in condensed phases in terms of the classical law of mass action, and provides a computational advance over existing methods for interacting systems. By picturing exchange in terms of classical association equilibrium, we arrive at a view (hinted at long ago by Feynman and by Penrose and Onsager) in which the Bose condensation is related to an equilibrium polymeric sol{\textendash}gel transition. Thus, below the l transition, the correlations in liquid helium are equivalent to those in a classical fluid containing a finite concentration of macroscopic polymers. We stress how the path integral aspect of the isomorphism leads to useful geometrical interpretations of quantum phenomena. For example, tunneling phenomena can be viewed in terms of solitonic (or instantonic) configurations or flexible chain molecules. With this picture, we show how the isomorphism can be employed to understand both adiabatic and nonadiabatic solvent effects on chemical bonding. For concreteness, we provide a detailed analysis of a particular model of the chemical bond for which a partial summation over intermediate quantum paths leads to an Ising model problem in the isomorphism. While applications like this are presented in the form of qualitative illustrations, a variety of methods can be employed to produce quantitative results. We sketch how these calculations can be performed for various problems, making connections with methods like the renormalization group (RG) technique. The classical isomorphism together with the modern theory of classical polyatomic systems provides a powerful framework for quantitative solutions of condensed matter quantum mechanical problems.},

In this paper, high-order resonances are shown to play a central role in establishing the transition to ergodic flow, which we call the quantum ergodicity transition, at low energy in many-dimensional systems. The location of the transition to global vibrational flow in a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators is found to be generally sensitive to high-order resonances. On the other hand, except immediately above the transition, rates of flow once established depend primarily on the familiar low-order terms until the molecule reaches much higher excitation. Both the orders of resonant coupling terms in the vibrational Hamiltonian important in determining the transition to ergodicity, and the orders relevant for determining vibrational relaxation rates in large molecules are found to scale in a simple way with the strength of resonant coupling terms and the size of the molecule.},

Pair correlations in conjunction with the a priori specification of the existence of a particularly low energy state provide a method of introducing the aspect of minimal frustration to the energy landscapes of random heteropolymers. The resulting funneled landscape exhibits both a phase transition from a molten globule to a folded state, and the heteropolymeric glass transition in the globular state. We model the folding transition in the self-averaging regime, which together with a simple theory of collapse allows us to depict folding as a double-well free energy surface in terms of suitable reaction coordinates. Observed trends in barrier positions and heights with protein sequence length and thermodynamic conditions are discussed within the context of the model. We also discuss the new physics which arises from the introduction of explicitly cooperative many-body interactions, as might arise from sidechain packing and nonadditive hydrophobic forces.},

The spectra of many basis states of similar energy are computed, for different values of the magnitude of the coupling in the Hamiltonian between these states. From individual spectra of zero order basis states at each coupling strength the individual survival probabilities are determined, which are then used in computing statistical averages. When the average fluctuation of the survival probability is small, in the strongly coupled limit, the average survival probability closely follows a semiclassical diffusion prediction and reflects a predicted linear dependence of the rate of energy flow on coupling strength. When the average fluctuation is large, in the weakly coupled limit, the average survival probability closely follows a power law decay of t{\textminus}1, in agreement with a quantum extension of the diffusion picture. In this regime, individual survival probabilities show strong quantum beats. We conclude that these large variations reflect a strong influence of quantum interference in the weakly coupled limit.},

Direct folding kinetics, diffusional coefficients and free energy profiles are determined from Monte Carlo simulations of a 27-mer, 3 letter code lattice model, which corresponds roughly to a small helical protein. Analytic folding calculations, using simple diffusive rate theory, agree extremely well with the full simulation results. Folding in this system is best seen as a diffusive, funnel-like process.},

 abstract = {An explicit droplet calculation is developed to address two aspects of the folding kinetics of large proteins: the thermodynamic folding barrier and the reconfiguration rate. First, a nonspecific folding nucleus is described as the instanton or droplet solution of a free energy functional derived for a minimally frustrated polymer Hamiltonian of the G{\={o}} type. Second, a theory for the barriers for transitions between trapped misfolded states is developed using a replica approach extended to inhomogeneous cases near the glass transition temperature of a random heteropolymer. Replica instantons are computed and their shape described. These two factors are then combined to give a microscopic theory of the folding time.},

 abstract = {The study of the sine-Gordon soliton model of the dielectric $\alpha$ relaxation in crystalline polymers is continued. We examine the intermediate range of the coupling constant, which is essentially the ratio of intramolecular to intermolecular interaction strengths, via another stochastic molecular dynamics computer simulation. The model is that of Currie et al. of the soliton as a pseudo-relativistic particle moving in an effective periodic potential. Comparison with the previous sine-Gordon chain simulation results in increasingly poor agreement with decreasing coupling constant, probably because of the neglect of multiple soliton effects. However, we find in the process the interesting result that relativity lowers the effective rate constant in such barrier-crossing problems. Finally, we also note that the continuum limit theory which is successful for nonpolar polymers may apply to other soliton-related physical systems as well.},

The density of excitations agrees with experiment and scales with the size of a dynamically coherent region at ${T}_{g}$, being about 200 molecules. The phonon coupling depends on the Lindemann ratio for vitrification yielding the observed universal relation $l/\ensuremath{\lambda}\ensuremath{\simeq}150$ between phonon wavelength $\ensuremath{\lambda}$ and mean free path $l$. Multilevel behavior is predicted to occur in the temperature range of the thermal conductivity plateau.},

 abstract = {The motions involved in barrier crossing for protein folding are investigated in terms of the chain dynamics of the polymer backbone, completing the microscopic description of protein folding presented in the preceding paper. Local reaction coordinates are identified as collective growth modes of the unstable fluctuations about the saddle points in the free energy surface. The description of the chain dynamics incorporates internal friction (independent of the solvent viscosity) arising from the elementary isomerization of the backbone dihedral angles. We find that the folding rate depends linearly on the solvent friction for high viscosity, but saturates at low viscosity because of internal friction. For $\lambda$-repressor, the calculated folding rate prefactor, along with the free energy barrier from the variational theory, gives a folding rate that agrees well with the experimentally determined rate under highly stabilizing conditions, but the theory predicts too large a folding rate at the transition midpoint. This discrepancy obtained using a fairly complete quantitative theory inspires a new set of questions about chain dynamics, specifically detailed motions in individual contact formation.},

 abstract = {A microscopic theory of the free energy barriers and folding routes for minimally frustrated proteins is presented, greatly expanding on the presentation of the variational approach outlined previously [J. J. Portman, S. Takada, and P. G. Wolynes, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 5237 (1998)]. We choose the $\lambda$-repressor protein as an illustrative example and focus on how the polymer chain statistics influence free energy profiles and partially ordered ensembles of structures. In particular, we investigate the role of chain stiffness on the free energy profile and folding routes. We evaluate the applicability of simpler approximations in which the conformations of the protein molecule along the folding route are restricted to have residues that are either entirely folded or unfolded in contiguous stretches. We find that the folding routes obtained from only one contiguous folded region corresponds to a chain with a much greater persistence length than appropriate for natural protein chains, while the folding route obtained from two contiguous folded regions is able to capture the relatively folded regions calculated within the variational approach. The free energy profiles obtained from the contiguous sequence approximations have larger barriers than the more microscopic variational theory which is understood as a consequence of partial ordering.},

The expansion is generalized so that the effect of other changes in the Hamiltonian, which would alone be best treated with a cumulant expansion, can be evaluated simultaneously. The effect of changing the excluded volume radii on various thermodynamic quantities, in particular the free energy and glass transition temperature, is calculated with the expansion and compared to results from simulation. The expansion is found to be sufficiently accurate at the second-order level to be useful for calculating values of the excluded volume radii that refine the energy landscape for structure prediction. This is explicitly checked by a free energy profile analysis and examining the quality of predictions before and after the optimization. A useful method to test whether equilibrium has been attained during molecular dynamics sampling is also described.},

 abstract = {According to the random first-order transition (RFOT) theory of glasses, the barriers for activated dynamics in supercooled liquids vanish as the temperature of a viscous liquid approaches the dynamical transition temperature from below. This occurs due to a decrease of the surface tension between local metastable molecular arrangements much like at a spinodal. The dynamical transition thus represents a crossover from the low T activated behavior to a collisional transport regime at high T. This barrier softening explains the deviation of the relaxation times, as a function of temperature, from the simple log $\tau$ $\propto$1/sc dependence at the high viscosity to a mode{\textendash}mode coupling dominated result at lower viscosity. By calculating the barrier softening effects, the RFOT theory provides a unified microscopic way to interpret structural relaxation data for many distinct classes of structural glass formers over the measured temperature range. The theory also provides an unambiguous procedure to determine the size of dynamically cooperative regions in the presence of barrier renormalization effects using the experimental temperature dependence of the relaxation times and the configurational entropy data. We use the RFOT theory framework to discuss data for tri-naphthyl benzene, salol, propanol, and silica as representative systems.},

 abstract = {<p>Large-scale motions of biomolecules involve linear elastic deformations along low-frequency normal modes, but for function nonlinearity is essential. In addition, unlike macroscopic machines, biological machines can locally break and then reassemble during function. We present a model for global structural transformations, such as allostery, that involve large-scale motion and possible partial unfolding, illustrating the method with the conformational transition of adenylate kinase. Structural deformation between open and closed states occurs via low-frequency modes on separate reactant and product surfaces, switching from one state to the other when energetically favorable. The switching model is the most straightforward anharmonic interpolation, which allows the barrier for a process to be estimated from a linear normal mode calculation, which by itself cannot be used for activated events. Local unfolding, or cracking, occurs in regions where the elastic stress becomes too high during the transition. Cracking leads to a counterintuitive catalytic effect of added denaturant on allosteric enzyme function. It also leads to unusual relationships between equilibrium constant and rate like those seen recently in single-molecule experiments of motor proteins.</p>},

 abstract = {The energy landscape theory of protein folding is a statistical description of a protein's potential surface. It assumes that folding occurs through organizing an ensemble of structures rather than through only a few uniquely defined structural intermediates. It suggests that the most realistic model of a protein is a minimally frustrated heteropolymer with a rugged funnel-like landscape biased toward the native structure. This statistical description has been developed using tools from the statistical mechanics of disordered systems, polymers, and phase transitions of finite systems. We review here its analytical background and contrast the phenomena in homopolymers, random heteropolymers, and protein-like heteropolymers that are kinetically and thermodynamically capable of folding. The connection between these statistical concepts and the results of minimalist models used in computer simulations is discussed. The review concludes with a brief discussion of how the theory helps in the interpretation of results from fast folding experiments and in the practical task of protein structure prediction.},

 abstract = {<p>Gene expression has a stochastic component because of the single-molecule nature of the gene and the small number of copies of individual DNA-binding proteins in the cell. We show how the statistics of such systems can be mapped onto quantum many-body problems. The dynamics of a single gene switch resembles the spin-boson model of a two-site polaron or an electron transfer reaction. Networks of switches can be approximately described as quantum spin systems by using an appropriate variational principle. In this way, the concept of frustration for magnetic systems can be taken over into gene networks. The landscape of stable attractors depends on the degree and style of frustration, much as for neural networks. We show the number of attractors, which may represent cell types, is much smaller for appropriately designed weakly frustrated stochastic networks than for randomly connected networks.</p>},

 abstract = {The energy landscape picture of protein folding and binding is employed to optimize a number of pair potentials for direct and water-mediated interactions in protein complex interfaces. We find that water-mediated interactions greatly complement direct interactions in discriminating against various types of trap interactions that model those present in the cell. We highlight the context dependent nature of knowledge-based binding potentials, as contrasted with the situation for autonomous folding. By performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the corresponding interaction matrixes, we rationalize the strength of the recognition signal for each combination of the contact type and reference trap states using the differential in the idealized {\textquotedblleft}canonical{\textquotedblright} amino acid compositions of native and trap layers. The comparison of direct and water-mediated contact potential matrixes emphasizes the importance of partial solvation in stabilizing charged groups in the protein interfaces. Specific water-mediated interresidue interactions are expected to influence significantly the kinetics as well as thermodynamics of protein association.},

@article{2004Levy:2004fqa,
 abstract = {<p>Protein recognition and binding, which result in either transient or long-lived complexes, play a fundamental role in many biological functions, but sometimes also result in pathologic aggregates. We use a simplified simulation model to survey a range of systems where two highly flexible protein chains form a homodimer. In all cases, this model, which corresponds to a perfectly funneled energy landscape for folding and binding, reproduces the macroscopic experimental observations on whether folding and binding are coupled in one step or whether intermediates occur. Owing to the minimal frustration principle, we find that, as in the case of protein folding, the native topology is the major factor that governs the choice of binding mechanism. Even when the monomer is stable on its own, binding sometimes occurs fastest through unfolded intermediates, thus showing the speedup envisioned in the fly-casting scenario for molecular recognition.</p>},

@article{2004of:wa,
 abstract = {The dark mystery of protein folding has been greatly illuminated by the last decade's work. This enlightenment has come from the simultaneous flowering of new theoretical approaches (1{\textendash}3), powerful computational studies (4, 5), and a fresh wave of experiments using protein engineering (6) and ultrafast kinetics (7, 8). How a disordered chain molecule finds its organized, folded state is no longer a paradox, but a scientific problem requiring a close comparison of theories, computation and experiments. A beautiful experimental study of the mechanism of folding of the B domain of streptococcal protein A appears in this issue of PNAS (9). This study joins such landmarks as the elucidation of the folding mechanism of CI2 and barnase by the same group (10). So what's the news? The excitement comes because this protein has been the poster child of computational folders. It is attractive to computationalists because of its small size, 60 residues, at the extreme limit exhibiting cooperative protein-like thermodynamics. The protein also folds fast, so computer studies have the best chance of success. Numerous simulations were carried out (11{\textendash}23) without extensive laboratory kinetic studies at the residue level to influence the work. It is thus interesting to see how well the computationalists have been able to predict the folding mechanism without much biasing data. Sato et al. (9) liken the comparison of simulations with their kinetic experiment to the biennial exercise Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) (24). They, like most participants in CASP, refer to it as a competition, although the organizers decry that appellation. As the leader of a participating group, I can testify to CASP's painfulness, but, despite its undignified similarity to a sporting event, good science comes from CASP. Likewise, the present results do indeed provoke serious thought. When compared {\ldots}},

@article{2005Bhattacharyya:vn,
 abstract = {A unified treatment of structural relaxation in a deeply supercooled glassy liquid is developed which extends the existing mode coupling theory (MCT) by incorporating, in a self-consistent way, the effects of activated events by using the concepts from the random first order transition (RFOT) theory. We show how the decay of the dynamic structure factor is modified by localized activated hopping events called instantons. The instanton vertex added to the usual MCT depicts the probability and consequences of such an event. In the vertex, the probability is proportional to $\mathrm{exp}(\ensuremath{-}A\slash{s}_{c})$ where ${s}_{c}$ is the configurational entropy. Close to the glass transition temperature, ${T}_{g}$, since ${s}_{c}$ is diminishing, the activated process slows beyond the time window and this eventually leads to an arrest of the structural relaxation as expected for glasses. The combined treatment describes the dynamic structure factor, $\ensuremath{\phi}(t)$, in deeply supercooled liquid fairly well. We show that below the mode coupling transition temperature, ${T}_{c},\phantom{\rule{0.3em}{0ex}}\ensuremath{\phi}(t)$ not only decays via the hopping channel but the otherwise frozen MCT part of $\ensuremath{\phi}(t)$ also shows a hopping induced decay. This decay is primarily due to the relaxation of the longitudinal viscosity which is otherwise divergent in the idealized MCT. We further show that although hopping motion induces a decay in the MCT part of $\ensuremath{\phi}(t)$, due to the self-consistent calculation, this effect is nonlinear in nature.},

@article{2005Shen:wg,
 abstract = {<p>Protein folding has become one of the best understood biochemical reactions from a kinetic viewpoint. The funneled energy landscape, a consequence of the minimal frustration achieved by evolution in sequences, explains how most proteins fold efficiently and robustly to their functional structure and allows robust prediction of folding kinetics. The folding of Rop (repressor of primer) dimer is exceptional because some of its mutants with a redesigned hydrophobic core both fold and unfold much faster than the WT protein, which seems to conflict with a simple funneled energy landscape for which topology mainly determines the kinetics. We propose that the mystery of Rop folding can be unraveled by assuming a double-funneled energy landscape on which there are two basins that correspond to distinct but related topological structures. Because of the near symmetry of the molecule, mutations can cause a conformational switch to a nearly degenerate yet distinct topology or lead to a mixture of both topologies. The topology predicted to have the lower free-energy barrier height for folding was further found by all-atom modeling to give a better structural fit for those mutants with the extreme folding and unfolding rates. Thus, the non-Hammond effects can be understood within energy-landscape theory if there are in fact two different but nearly degenerate structures for Rop. Mutations in symmetric and regular structures may give rise to frustration and thus result in degeneracy.</p>},

@article{2006Latzer:ul,
 abstract = {We examine the ability of Bayesian methods to recreate structural ensembles for partially folded molecules from averaged data. Specifically we test the ability of various algorithms to recreate different transition state ensembles for folding proteins using a multiple replica simulation algorithm using input from {\textquotedblleft}gold standard{\textquotedblright} reference ensembles that were first generated with a G{\={o}}-like Hamiltonian having nonpairwise additive terms. A set of low resolution data, which function as the {\textquotedblleft}experimental{\textquotedblright} $\phi$ values, were first constructed from this reference ensemble. The resulting $\phi$ values were then treated as one would treat laboratory experimental data and were used as input in the replica reconstruction algorithm. The resulting ensembles of structures obtained by the replica algorithm were compared to the gold standard reference ensemble, from which those {\textquotedblleft}data{\textquotedblright} were, in fact, obtained. It is found that for a unimodal transition state ensemble with a low barrier, the multiple replica algorithm does recreate the reference ensemble fairly successfully when no experimental error is assumed. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as well as principal component analysis show that the overlap of the recovered and reference ensembles is significantly enhanced when multiple replicas are used. Reduction of the multiple replica ensembles by clustering successfully yields subensembles with close similarity to the reference ensembles. On the other hand, for a high barrier transition state with two distinct transition state ensembles, the single replica algorithm only samples a few structures of one of the reference ensemble basins. This is due to the fact that the $\phi$ values are intrinsically ensemble averaged quantities. The replica algorithm with multiple copies does sample both reference ensemble basins. In contrast to the single replica case, the multiple replicas are constrained to reproduce the average $\phi$ values, but allow fluctuations in $\phi$ for each individual copy. These fluctuations facilitate a more faithful sampling of the reference ensemble basins. Finally, we test how robustly the reconstruction algorithm can function by introducing errors in $\phi$ comparable in magnitude to those suggested by some authors. In this circumstance we observe that the chances of ensemble recovery with the replica algorithm are poor using a single replica, but are improved when multiple copies are used. A multimodal transition state ensemble, however, turns out to be more sensitive to large errors in $\phi$ (if appropriately gauged) and attempts at successful recreation of the reference ensemble with simple replica algorithms can fall short.},

The mechanisms of conformational transition depend on the protein basin topologies and change with temperature near the folding transition. The conformational transition rate varies linearly with driving force over a fairly large range.

 abstract = {The folding of $\alpha$/$\beta$ proteins involves most of the commonly known structural and dynamic complexities of the protein energy landscapes. Thus, the interplay among different structural components, taking into account the cooperative interactions, is important in determining the success of protein structure prediction. In this work we present further developments of our knowledge-based force field for $\alpha$/$\beta$ proteins, introducing more realistic modeling of many-body interactions governing the folding of $\beta$-sheets. The model's innovations highlight both specific topological characteristics of secondary structures and the generic nonadditive interactions that are mediated by water. We also investigate how a coarse biasing of the protein morphology can be used to understand the role of heterogeneity in protein collapse. Analysis of the simulation results for three test $\alpha$/$\beta$ proteins indicates that the addition of the topological and many-body ingredients to the model helps to greatly reduce the roughness in the energy landscape. Consequently, high quality candidate structures for $\alpha$/$\beta$ proteins can be generated from simulated annealing runs, using very modest amounts of computer time.},

@article{2006Stevenson:2006kfa,
 abstract = {The cooperative rearrangement of groups of many molecules has long been thought to underlie the dramatic slowing of liquid dynamics on cooling towards the glassy state. For instance, there exists experimental evidence for cooperatively rearranging regions (CRRs) on the nanometre length scale near the glass transition. The random first-order transition (RFOT) theory of glasses predicts that, near the glass-transition temperature, these regions are compact, but computer simulations and experiments on colloids suggest CRRs are string-like. Here, we present a microscopic theory within the framework of RFOT, which unites the two situations. We show that the shapes of CRRs in glassy liquids should change from being compact at low temperatures to fractal or {\textquoteleft}stringy{\textquoteright} as the dynamical crossover temperature from activated to collisional transport is approached from below. This theory predicts a correlation of the ratio of the dynamical crossover temperature to the laboratory glass-transition temperature, and the heat-capacity discontinuity at the glass transition. The predicted correlation quantitatively agrees with experimental results for 21 materials.},

 abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin is a 128-residue $\beta$-sandwich metalloprotein; in vitro kinetic experiments have shown that it folds in a two-state reaction. Here, we used a variational free energy functional to calculate the characteristics of the transition state ensemble (TSE) for folding of the apo-form of P. aeruginosa azurin and investigate how it responds to thermal and mutational changes. The variational method directly yields predicted chevron plots for wild-type and mutant apo-forms of azurin. In parallel, we performed in vitro kinetic-folding experiments on the same set of azurin variants using chemical perturbation. Like the wild-type protein, all apo-variants fold in apparent two-state reactions both in calculations and in stopped-flow mixing experiments. Comparisons of phi ($\varphi$) values determined from the experimental and theoretical chevron parameters reveal an excellent agreement for most positions, indicating a polarized, highly structured TSE for folding of P. aeruginosa apo-azurin. We also demonstrate that careful analysis of side-chain interactions is necessary for appropriate theoretical description of core mutants.},

 abstract = {Random first-order transition theory is used to determine the role of attractive and repulsive interactions in the dynamics of supercooled liquids. Self-consistent phonon theory, an approximate mean field treatment consistent with random first-order transition theory, is used to treat individual glassy configurations, whereas the liquid phase is treated using common liquid-state approximations. Free energies are calculated using liquid-state perturbation theory. The transition temperature,, the temperature where the onset of activated behavior is predicted by mean field theory; the lower crossover temperature,, where barrierless motions actually occur through fractal or stringy motions (corresponding to the phenomenological mode coupling transition temperature); and, the Kauzmann temperature (corresponding to an extrapolated entropy crisis), are calculated in addition to, the glass transition temperature that corresponds to laboratory cooling rates. Relationships between these quantities agree well with existing experimental and simulation data on van der Waals liquids. Both the isobaric and isochoric behavior in the supercooled regime are studied, providing results for $\Delta$CV and $\Delta$Cp that can be used to calculate the fragility as a function of density and pressure, respectively. The predicted variations in the $\alpha$-relaxation time with temperature and density conform to the empirical density{\textminus}temperature scaling relations found by Casalini and Roland. We thereby demonstrate the microscopic origin of their observations. Finally, the relationship first suggested by Sastry between the spinodal temperature and the Kauzmann temperatures, as a function of density, is examined. The present microscopic calculations support the existence of an intersection of these two temperatures at sufficiently low temperatures.},

 abstract = {<p>Understanding how the folding of proteins establishes their functional characteristics at the molecular level challenges both theorists and experimentalists. The simplest test beds for confronting this issue are provided by electron transfer proteins. The environment provided by the folded protein to the cofactor tunes the metal9s electron transport capabilities as envisioned in the entatic hypothesis. To see how the entatic state is achieved one must study how the folding landscape affects and in turn is affected by the metal. Here, we develop a coarse-grained functional to explicitly model how the coordination of the metal (which results in a so-called entatic or rack-induced state) modifies the folding of the metallated <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> azurin. Our free-energy functional-based approach directly yields the proper nonlinear extra-thermodynamic free energy relationships for the kinetics of folding the wild type and several point-mutated variants of the metallated protein. The results agree quite well with corresponding laboratory experiments. Moreover, our modified free-energy functional provides a sufficient level of detail to explicitly model how the geometric entatic state of the metal modifies the dynamic folding nucleus of azurin.</p>},

 abstract = {<p>The dynamics and diversity of proliferating cellular populations are governed by the interplay between the growth and death rates among the various phenotypes within a colony. In addition, epigenetic multistability can cause cells to spontaneously switch from one phenotype to another. By examining a generalized form of the relative variance of populations and classifying it into intracolony and cross-colony contributions, we study the origins and consequences of cellular population variability. We find that the variability can depend highly on the initial conditions and the constraints placed on the population by the growth environment. We construct a two-phenotype model system and examine, analytically and numerically, its time-dependent variability in both unbounded and population-limited growth environments. We find that in unbounded growth environments the overall variability is strictly governed by the initial conditions. In contrast, when the overall population is limited by the environment, the system eventually relaxes to a unique fixed point regardless of the initial conditions. However, the transient decay to the fixed point depends highly on initial conditions, and the time scale over which the variability decays can be very long, depending on the intrinsic time scales of the system. These results provide insights into the origins of population variability and suggest mechanisms in which variability can arise in commonly used experimental approaches.</p>},

@article{2008Bagchi:ux,
 abstract = {<p>In low-temperature-supercooled liquids, below the ideal mode-coupling theory transition temperature, hopping and continuous diffusion are seen to coexist. Here, we present a theory that shows explicitly the interplay between the two processes and shows that activated hopping facilitates continuous diffusion in the otherwise frozen liquid. Several universal features arise from nonlinear interactions between the continuous diffusive dynamics described here by the mode coupling theory (MCT)] and the activated hopping (described here by the random first-order transition theory). We apply the theory to a specific system, Salol, to show that the theory correctly predicts the temperature dependence of the nonexponential stretching parameter, $\beta$, and the primary $\alpha$ relaxation timescale, $\tau$. The study explains why, even below the mean field ergodic to nonergodic transition, the dynamics is well described by MCT. The nonlinear coupling between the two dynamical processes modifies the relaxation behavior of the structural relaxation from what would be predicted by a theory with a complete static Gaussian barrier distribution in a manner that may be described as a facilitation effect. Furthermore, the theory correctly predicts the observed variation of the stretching exponent $\beta$ with the fragility parameter, <i>D</i>. These two predictions also allow the complexity growth to be predicted, in good agreement with the results of Capaccioli <i>et al.</i> [Capaccioli S, Ruocco G, Zamponi F (2008) <i>J Phys Chem B</i> 112:10652-10658].</p>},

We show how to generate stochastic dynamics for systems which suffer more than one type of collision, and derive the appropriate master equation for the phase space distribution function. We discuss a variety of different collision models and sketch how one might deduce the form and parameters of the model from experiment and molecular dynamics. Finally, we examine a one-dimensional model of an isomerization reaction in the presence of two types of collisions, finding that the reaction rate varies nonlinearly with the various collision rates.},

@article{2008Bhattacharyya:txb,
 abstract = {In low temperature supercooled liquid, below the ideal mode coupling theory transition temperature, hopping and continuous diffusion are seen to coexist. We present a theory which incorporates interaction between the two processes and shows that hopping can induce continuous diffusion in the otherwise frozen liquid. Several universal features arise from nonlinear interactions between the continuous diffusive dynamics (described here by the mode coupling theory (MCT)) and the activated hopping (described here by the random first order transition theory). We apply the theory to real systems (Salol) to show that the theory correctly predicts the temperature dependence of the non-exponential stretching parameter, $\beta$, and the primary $\alpha$ relaxation timescale, $\tau$. The study explains why, even below the ergodic to non-ergodic transition, the dynamics is well described by MCT. The non-linear coupling between the two dynamical processes modifies the relaxation behavior of the structural relaxation from what would be predicted by a theory with a complete static Gaussian barrier distribution in a manner that may be described as a facilitation effect. Furthermore, the theory explains the observed variation of the stretching exponent $\beta$ with the fragility parameter, $D$.},

We show that the soliton solutions of this model are very similar to the twist defects proposed, on the basis of detailed conformational energy studies, by Mansfield and Boyd as a mechanism for the $\alpha$-relaxation process in crystalline polyethylene. Allowing for the possibility that the soliton solutions describe Brownian motion, we make the connection to the theory of dielectric relaxation, showing that the macroscopic decay function is given approximately by the hopping correlation function previously derived by us. More generally, we argue that this decay function arises from the one-dimensional Brownian motion of unspecified defects. When the phenomenological friction constant is very large, we find agreement between our result and the theory of defect diffusion. We then briefly discuss dielectric relaxation in amorphous polymers, noting that our decay function is similar in several respects to the successful empirical decay function proposed by Williams and Watts.},

Neglecting static perturbations of structure at the surface, we use random first order transition (RFOT) theory to show the free energy barrier for activated motion near a free surface should be half that of the bulk at the same temperature. The increased mobility allows the surface layers to descend much further on the energy landscape than the bulk ordinarily does. The simplified RFOT calculation, however, predicts a limiting value for the configurational entropy a vapor deposited glass may reach as a function of deposition rate. We sketch how mode coupling effects extend the excess free surface mobility into the bulk so that the glass transition temperature is measurably perturbed at depths greater than the naive length scale of dynamic cooperativity.},

 abstract = {Characterizing the phase diagram for proteins is important both for laboratory studies and for the development of structure prediction algorithms. Using a variational scheme, we calculated the generic features of the protein thermostability over a large range of temperatures for a set of more than 50 different proteins using a model based on native structure alone. Focusing on a specific system, protein G, we further examined, using a more realistic model that includes the nonnative interaction, the thermostability of both the native state and a collection of trap structures. By surveying the native structures for many proteins and by paying closer attention to the various trap structures of protein G, we obtained an overall understanding of the folding dynamics far from the conditions usually focused on; namely, those near the folding temperature alone. Two characteristic temperatures (shown to scale with folding temperature in general) signal drastic changes in the folding mechanism. The variational calculations suggest that most proteins would, indeed, fold in a barrierless manner below a critical temperature analogous to a spinodal in crystallization. For fixed interaction strengths, this temperature, however, seems to be generally very low, ∼50% of the equilibrium folding temperature. Likewise, native proteins, in general, would unfold in a completely barrierless way at a temperature 25% above folding temperature according to these variational calculations. We also studied the distribution of free energy profiles for escape from a set of trap structures generated by simulations.},

 abstract = {The alkaline-induced structural transitions of ferricytochrome c have been studied intensively as a model for how changes in metal ligation contribute to protein function and folding. Previous studies have demonstrated that multiple non-native species accumulate with increasing pH. Here, we used a combination of experiments and simulations to provide a high-resolution view of the changes associated with increasing alkaline conditions. Alkaline-induced transitions were characterized under equilibrium conditions by following changes in the IR absorptions of carbon{\textminus}deuterium chromophores incorporated at Leu68, Lys72, Lys73, Lys79, and Met80. The data suggest that at least four intermediates are formed as the pH is increased prior to complete unfolding of the protein. The first alkaline transition observed appears to be driven by a single deprotonation and occurs with a midpoint of pH 8.8, but surprisingly, the intermediate formed does not appear to be one of the well-characterized lysine misligates. At higher pH, second and third deprotonations, with a combined apparent midpoint pH of 10.2, induce transitions to Lys73- or Lys79-misligated species. Interestingly, the lysine misligates appear to undergo iron reduction by the coordinated amine. A transition from the lysine misligates to another intermediate, likely a hydroxide-misligated species, is associated with a fourth deprotonation and a midpoint of pH 10.7. Finally, the protein loses tertiary structure with a fifth deprotonation that occurs with a midpoint of pH 12.7. Native topology-based models with enforced misligation are employed to help understand the structures of the observed intermediates.},

The approach is based on a heuristic development starting from a resolution of the force{\textendash}force correlation function of a Brownian ion, into parts depending on the attractive ion{\textendash}solvent interaction and a repulsive, hard core ion{\textendash}solvent interaction. We show that in the limit of infinitely weak, long range attractive ion{\textendash}solvent interactions the molecular theory reduces to the phenomenological dielectric friction picture for the drag on an ion. The molecular theory also gives sensible results in the case of strong, short range attractive interactions. In this case the theory essentially indicates that the drag on the ion reduces to the drag on a composite body, i.e., a solventberg consisting of the ion and the molecules in the first solvation shell.},

However, exact calculations using hydrodynamics with stick boundary conditions have the unsatisfactory feature of predicting a vanishing coagulation rate. In this paper it is demonstrated that this failure of the theory is due to the stick boundary conditions. It is shown that hydrodynamic calculations with slip boundary conditions yield a finite coagulation rate. The exact slip hydrodynamics result indicates a reduction of 29% in the coagulation rate of neutral particles relative to the classical Smoluchowski theory.

@article{2009Cho:up,
 abstract = {<p>Energy landscape theory requires that the protein-folding mechanism is generally globally directed or funneled toward the native state. The collective nature of transition state ensembles further suggests that sufficient averaging of the native interactions can occur so that the knowledge of the native topology may suffice for predicting the mechanism. Nevertheless, while simple homogeneously weighted native topology-based models predict the folding mechanisms for many proteins, for other proteins knowledge of the native topology, by itself, seems not to suffice in determining the folding mechanism. Simulations of proteins with differing topologies reveal that the failure of homogeneously weighted topology-based models can, however, be completely understood within the framework of a funneled energy landscape and can be quantified by comparing the fluctuation of entropy cost for forming contacts to the expected fluctuations in contact energy. To be precise, we find the transition state ensembles of proteins with all-$\alpha$ topologies, which are more uniform in the specific entropy cost of contact formation, have transition state ensembles that are more readily perturbed by differences in energetic weights than are the transition state ensembles of proteins with significant amounts of $\beta$-structure, where the specific entropy costs of contact formation are more widely distributed. This behavior is consistent with a random-field Ising model analogy that follows from the free energy functional approach to folding.</p>},

In particular we derive a relation between the length scale for dynamic heterogeneity and the related barrier fluctuations. Diluted entropic droplets are shown to have a Gaussian distribution of barriers, strongly suggesting that non-Gaussian behavior results from droplet-droplet interactions.},

 abstract = {<p>Bacteria serve as the central arena for understanding how gene networks and proteins process information and control cellular behaviors. Recently, much effort has been devoted to the investigation of specific bacteria gene circuits as functioning modules. The next challenge is the integrative modeling of complex cellular networks composed of many such modules. A tractable integrative model of the sophisticated decision-making signal transduction system that determines the fate between sporulation and competence is presented. This model provides an understanding of how information is sensed and processed to reach an {\textquotedblleft}informative{\textquotedblright} decision in the context of cell state and signals from other cells. The competence module (ComK dynamics) is modeled as a stochastic switch whose transition rate is controlled by a quorum-sensing unit. The sporulation module (Spo0A dynamics) is modeled as a timer whose clock rate is adjusted by a stress-sensing unit. The interplay between these modules is mediated via the Rap assessment system, which gates the sensing units, and the AbrB{\textendash}Rok decision module, which creates an opportunity for competence within a specific window of the sporulation timer. The timer is regulated via a special repressilator-like inhibition of Spo0A* by Spo0E, which is itself inhibited by AbrB. For some stress and input signals, this repressilator can generate a frustration state with large variations (fluctuations or oscillations) in Spo0A* and AbrB concentrations, which might serve an important role in generating cell variability. This integrative framework is a starting point that can be extended to include transition into cannibalism and the role of colony organization.</p>},

Longer proteins encounter kinetic sampling limitations in fragment assembly not seen in molecular dynamics which generally samples more native-like conformations. We also present a fragment enriched version of the standard AMW energy function, AMW-FME, which incorporates the local sequence alignment derived fragment libraries from fragment assembly directly into the energy function.

 abstract = {The folding pathway and rate coefficients of the folding of a knotted protein are calculated for a potential energy function with minimal energetic frustration. A kinetic transition network is constructed using the discrete path sampling approach, and the resulting potential energy surface is visualized by constructing disconnectivity graphs. Owing to topological constraints, the low-lying portion of the landscape consists of three distinct regions, corresponding to the native knotted state and to configurations where either the N or C terminus is not yet folded into the knot. The fastest folding pathways from denatured states exhibit early formation of the N terminus portion of the knot and a rate-determining step where the C terminus is incorporated. The low-lying minima with the N terminus knotted and the C terminus free therefore constitute an off-pathway intermediate for this model. The insertion of both the N and C termini into the knot occurs late in the folding process, creating large energy barriers that are the rate limiting steps in the folding process. When compared to other protein folding proteins of a similar length, this system folds over six orders of magnitude more slowly.},

@article{2010Romesberg:tm,
 abstract = {The covalently bound heme cofactor plays a dominant role in the folding of cytochrome c. Because of the complicated inorganic chemistry of the heme, some might consider the folding of cytochrome c to be a special case, following principles different from those used to describe the folding of proteins without cofactors. Recent investigations, however, demonstrate that common models describing folding for many proteins work well for cytochrome c when heme is explicitly introduced, generally providing results that agree with experimental observations. In this Account, we first discuss results from simple native structure-based models. These models include attractive interactions between nonadjacent residues only if they are present in the crystal structure at pH 7. Because attractive nonnative contacts are not included in native structure-based models, their energy landscapes can be described as {\textquotedblleft}perfectly funneled{\textquotedblright}. In other words, native structure-based models are energetically guided towards the native state and contain no energetic traps that would hinder folding. Energetic traps are denoted sources of {\textquotedblleft}frustration{\textquotedblright}, which cause specific transient intermediates to be populated. Native structure-based models do, however, include repulsion between residues due to excluded volume. Nonenergetic traps can therefore exist if the chain, which cannot cross over itself, must partially unfold so that folding can proceed. The ability of native structure-based models to capture this kind of motion is partly responsible for their successful predictions of folding pathways for many types of proteins. Models without frustration describe the sequence of folding events for cytochrome c well (as inferred from hydrogen-exchange experiments), thereby justifying their use as a starting point. At low pH, the experimentally observed folding sequence of cytochrome c deviates from that at pH 7 and from models with perfectly funneled energy landscapes. Here, alternate folding pathways are a result of {\textquotedblleft}chemical frustration{\textquotedblright}. This frustration arises because some regions of the protein are destabilized more than others due to the heterogeneous distribution of titratable residues that are protonated at low pH. Beginning with native structure-based terms, we construct more complex models by adding chemical frustration. These more complex models only modestly perturb the energy landscape, which remains, overall, well funneled. These perturbed models can accurately describe how alternative folding pathways are used at low pH. At alkaline pH, cytochrome c populates distinctly different structural ensembles. For instance, lysine residues are deprotonated and compete for the heme ligation site. The same models that can describe folding at low pH also predict well the structures and relative stabilities of intermediates populated at alkaline pH. The success of models based on funneled energy landscapes suggest that cytochrome c folding is driven primarily by native contacts. The presence of heme appears to add chemical complexity to the folding process, but it does not require fundamental modification of the general principles used to describe folding. Moreover, its added complexity provides a valuable means of probing the folding energy landscape in greater detail than is possible with simpler systems.},

@article{2010Stevenson:2010el,
 abstract = {In recent years it has become widely accepted that a dynamical length scale $\xi$$\alpha$ plays an important role in supercooled liquids near the glass transition. We examine the implications of the interplay between the growing $\xi$$\alpha$ and the size of the crystal nucleus, $\xi$M, which shrinks on cooling. We argue that at low temperatures where $\xi$$\alpha$ > $\xi$M a new crystallization mechanism emerges, enabling rapid development of a large scale web of sparsely connected crystallinity. Though we predict this web percolates the system at too low a temperature to be easily seen in the laboratory, there are noticeable residual effects near the glass transition that can account for several previously observed unexplained phenomena of deeply supercooled liquids including Fischer clusters and anomalous crystal growth near Tg.},

AWSEM contains physically motivated terms, such as hydrogen bonding, as well as a bioinformatically based local structure biasing term, which efficiently takes into account many-body effects that are modulated by the local sequence. When combined with appropriate local or global alignments to choose memories, AWSEM can be used to perform de novo protein structure prediction. Herein we present structure prediction results for a particular choice of local sequence alignment method based on short residue sequences called fragments. We demonstrate the model{\textquoteright}s structure prediction capabilities for three levels of global homology between the target sequence and those proteins used for local structure biasing, all of which assume that the structure of the target sequence is not known. When there are no homologues in the database of structures used for local structure biasing, AWSEM calculations produce structural predictions that are somewhat improved compared with prior works using related approaches. The inclusion of a small number of structures from homologous sequences improves structure prediction only marginally, but when the fragment search is restricted to only homologous sequences, AWSEM can perform high resolution structure prediction and can be used for kinetics and dynamics studies.},

@article{2012Davtyan:uc,
 abstract = {<p>We investigate protein{\textendash}protein association using the associative-memory, water-mediated, structure, and energy model (AWSEM), a coarse-grained protein folding model that has been optimized using energy-landscape theory. The potential was originally parameterized by enforcing a funneled nature for a database of dimeric interfaces but was later further optimized to create funneled folding landscapes for individual monomeric proteins. The ability of the model to predict interfaces was not tested previously. The present results show that simulated annealing of the model indeed is able to predict successfully the native interfaces of eight homodimers and four heterodimers, thus amounting to a flexible docking algorithm. We go on to address the relative importance of monomer geometry, flexibility, and nonnative intermonomeric contacts in the association process for the homodimers. Monomer surface geometry is found to be important in determining the binding interface, but it is insufficient. Using a uniform binding potential rather than the water-mediated potential results in sampling of misbound structures that are geometrically preferred but are nonetheless energetically disfavored by AWSEM, as well as in nature. Depending on the stability of the unbound monomers, nonnative contacts play different roles in the association process. For unstable monomers, thermodynamic states stabilized by nonnative interactions correspond to productive, on-pathway intermediates and can, therefore, catalyze binding through a fly-casting mechanism. For stable monomers, in contrast, states stabilized by nonnative interactions generally correspond to traps that impede binding.</p>},

 abstract = {<p>Contractile forces are essential for many developmental processes involving cell shape change and tissue deformation. Recent experiments on reconstituted actomyosin networks, the major component of the contractile machinery, have shown that active contractility occurs above a threshold motor concentration and within a window of cross-link concentration. We present a microscopic dynamic model that incorporates two essential aspects of actomyosin self-organization: the asymmetric load response of individual actin filaments and the correlated motor-driven events mimicking myosin-induced filament sliding. Using computer simulations, we examine how the concentration and susceptibility of motors contribute to their collective behavior and interplay with the network connectivity to regulate macroscopic contractility. Our model is shown to capture the formation and dynamics of contractile structures and agree with the observed dependence of active contractility on microscopic parameters, including the contractility onset. Cooperative action of load-resisting motors in a force-percolating structure integrates local contraction/buckling events into a global contractile state via an active coarsening process, in contrast to the flow transition driven by uncorrelated kicks of susceptible motors.</p>},

@article{2013Rabochiy:ws,
 abstract = {We compute the temperature-dependent barrier for $\alpha$-relaxations in several liquids, without adjustable parameters, using experimentally determined elastic, structural, and calorimetric data. We employ the random first order transition (RFOT) theory, in which relaxation occurs via activated reconfigurations between distinct, aperiodic minima of the free energy. Two different approximations for the mismatch penalty between the distinct aperiodic states are compared, one due to Xia and Wolynes (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000, 97, 2990), which scales universally with temperature as for hard spheres, and one due to Rabochiy and Lubchenko (J. Chem. Phys. 2013, 138, 12A534), which employs measured elastic and structural data for individual substances. The agreement between the predictions and experiment is satisfactory, given the uncertainty in the measured experimental inputs. The explicitly computed barriers are used to calculate the glass transition temperature for each substance{\textemdash}a kinetic quantity{\textemdash}from the static input data alone. The temperature dependence of both the elastic and structural constants enters the temperature dependence of the barrier over an extended range to a degree that varies from substance to substance. The lowering of the configurational entropy, however, seems to be the dominant contributor to the barrier increase near the laboratory glass transition, consistent with previous experimental tests of the RFOT theory using the XW approximation. In addition, we compute the temperature dependence of the dynamical correlation length, also without using adjustable parameters. These agree well with experimental estimates obtained using the Berthier et al. (Science 2005, 310, 1797) procedure. Finally, we find the temperature dependence of the complexity of a rearranging region is consistent with the picture based on the RFOT theory but is in conflict with the assumptions of the Adam{\textendash}Gibbs and {\textquotedblleft}shoving{\textquotedblright} scenarios for the viscous slowing down in supercooled liquids.},

 abstract = {We explore the similarities and differences between the energy landscapes of proteins that have been selected by nature and those of some proteins designed by humans. Natural proteins have evolved to function as well as fold, and this is a source of energetic frustration. The sequence of Top7, on the other hand, was designed with architecture alone in mind using only native state stability as the optimization criterion. Its topology had not previously been observed in nature. Experimental studies show that the folding kinetics of Top7 is more complex than the kinetics of folding of otherwise comparable naturally occurring proteins. In this paper, we use structure prediction tools, frustration analysis, and free energy profiles to illustrate the folding landscapes of Top7 and two other proteins designed by Takada. We use both perfectly funneled (structure-based) and predictive (transferable) models to gain insight into the role of topological versus energetic frustration in these systems and show how they differ from those found for natural proteins. We also study how robust the folding of these designs would be to the simplification of the sequences using fewer amino acid types. Simplification using a five amino acid type code results in comparable quality of structure prediction to the full sequence in some cases, while the two-letter simplification scheme dramatically reduces the quality of structure prediction.},

@article{2013Wang:vi,
 abstract = {Signatures of glassy dynamics have been identified experimentally for a rich variety of materials in which molecular networks provide rigidity. Here we present a theoretical framework to study the glassy behavior of both passive and active network materials. We construct a general microscopic network model that incorporates nonlinear elasticity of individual filaments and steric constraints due to crowding. Based on constructive analogies between structural glass forming liquids and random field Ising magnets implemented using a heterogeneous self-consistent phonon method, our scheme provides a microscopic approach to determine the mismatch surface tension and the configurational entropy, which compete in determining the barrier for structural rearrangements within the random first order transition theory of escape from a local energy minimum. The influence of crosslinking on the fragility of inorganic network glass formers is recapitulated by the model. For active network materials, the mapping, which correlates the glassy characteristics to the network architecture and properties of nonequilibrium motor processes, is shown to capture several key experimental observations on the cytoskeleton of living cells: Highly connected tense networks behave as strong glass formers; intense motor action promotes reconfiguration. The fact that our model assuming a negative motor susceptibility predicts the latter suggests that on average the motorized processes in living cells do resist the imposed mechanical load. Our calculations also identify a spinodal point where simultaneously the mismatch penalty vanishes and the mechanical stability of amorphous packing disappears.},

 abstract = {<p>We explore the hypothesis that the folding landscapes of membrane proteins are funneled once the proteins{\textquoteright} topology within the membrane is established. We extend a protein folding model, the associative memory, water-mediated, structure, and energy model (AWSEM) by adding an implicit membrane potential and reoptimizing the force field to account for the differing nature of the interactions that stabilize proteins within lipid membranes, yielding a model that we call AWSEM-membrane. Once the protein topology is set in the membrane, hydrophobic attractions play a lesser role in finding the native structure, whereas polar{\textendash}polar attractions are more important than for globular proteins. We examine both the quality of predictions made with AWSEM-membrane when accurate knowledge of the topology and secondary structure is available and the quality of predictions made without such knowledge, instead using bioinformatically inferred topology and secondary structure based on sequence alone. When no major errors are made by the bioinformatic methods used to assign the topology of the transmembrane helices, these two types of structure predictions yield roughly equivalent quality structures. Although the predictive energy landscape is transferable and not structure based, within the correct topological sector we find the landscape is indeed very funneled: Thermodynamic landscape analysis indicates that both the total potential energy and the contact energy decrease as native contacts are formed. Nevertheless the near symmetry of different helical packings with respect to native contact formation can result in multiple packings with nearly equal thermodynamic occupancy, especially at temperatures just below collapse.</p>},

Prominent examples include the cell cycle and cellular signaling. There are two primary sources of noise in these oscillators: the binary character of gene states and the low copy numbers of proteins. This molecular noise induces dephasing in oscillators in analogy to the way imperfections in clocks lead to disparities in time. We can study how these two distinct sources contribute to dephasing and how well it can be approximated by adding noise to a macroscopic model. Using the <i>NF$\kappa$B</i>/<i>I$\kappa$B</i> oscillator as an example, we find that gene noise leads to significant deviations from the often-used phenomenological models.</p>},

 abstract = {Molecular noise in gene regulatory networks has two intrinsic components, one part being due to fluctuations caused by the birth and death of protein or mRNA molecules which are often present in small numbers and the other part arising from gene state switching, a single molecule event. Stochastic dynamics of gene regulatory circuits appears to be largely responsible for bifurcations into a set of multi-attractor states that encode different cell phenotypes. The interplay of dichotomous single molecule gene noise with the nonlinear architecture of genetic networks generates rich and complex phenomena. In this paper, we elaborate on an approximate framework that leads to simple hybrid multi-scale schemes well suited for the quantitative exploration of the steady state properties of large-scale cellular genetic circuits. Through a path sum based analysis of trajectory statistics, we elucidate the connection of these hybrid schemes to the underlying master equation and provide a rigorous justification for using dichotomous noise based models to study genetic networks. Numerical simulations of circuit models reveal that the contribution of the genetic noise of single molecule origin to the total noise is significant for a wide range of kinetic regimes.},

Simulations of the ensemble of chromosome conformations based on the resulting information theoretic landscape not only accurately reproduce experimental contact probabilities, but also provide a picture of chromosome dynamics and topology. The topology of the simulated chromosomes is probed by computing the distribution of their knot invariants. The simulated chromosome structures are largely free of knots. Topologically associating domains are shown to be crucial for establishing these knotless structures. The simulated chromosome conformations exhibit a tendency to form fibril-like structures like those observed via light microscopy. The topologically associating domains of the interphase chromosome exhibit multistability with varying liquid crystalline ordering that may allow discrete unfolding events and the landscape is locally funneled toward {\textquotedblleft}ideal{\textquotedblright} chromosome structures that represent hierarchical fibrils of fibrils.</p>},

 abstract = {The nucleosome is the fundamental unit for packaging the genome. A detailed molecular picture for its conformational dynamics is crucial for understanding transcription and gene regulation. We investigate the disassembly of single nucleosomes using a predictive coarse-grained protein DNA model with transferable force fields. This model quantitatively describes the thermodynamic stability of both the histone core complex and the nucleosome and predicts rates of transient nucleosome opening that match experimental measurements. Quantitative characterization of the free-energy landscapes reveals the mechanism of nucleosome unfolding in which DNA unwinding and histone protein disassembly are coupled. The interfaces between H2A-H2B dimers and the (H3-H4)2 tetramer are first lost when the nucleosome opens releasing a large fraction but not all of its bound DNA. For the short strands studied in single molecule experiments, the DNA unwinds asymmetrically from the histone proteins, with only one of its two ends preferentially exposed. The detailed molecular mechanism revealed in this work provides a structural basis for interpreting experimental studies of nucleosome unfolding.},

 abstract = {<p>Aplysia cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) protein, a translational regulator that recruits mRNAs and facilitates translation, has been shown to be a key component in the formation of long-term memory. Experimental data show that CPEB exists in at least a low-molecular weight coiled-coil oligomeric form and an amyloid fiber form involving the Q-rich domain (CPEB-Q). Using a coarse-grained energy landscape model, we predict the structures of the low-molecular weight oligomeric form and the dynamics of their transitions to the $\beta$-form. Up to the decamer, the oligomeric structures are predicted to be coiled coils. Free energy profiles confirm that the coiled coil is the most stable form for dimers and trimers. The structural transition from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ is shown to be concentration dependent, with the transition barrier decreasing with increased concentration. We observe that a mechanical pulling force can facilitate the $\alpha$-helix to $\beta$-sheet ($\alpha$-to-$\beta$) transition by lowering the free energy barrier between the two forms. Interactome analysis of the CPEB protein suggests that its interactions with the cytoskeleton could provide the necessary mechanical force. We propose that, by exerting mechanical forces on CPEB oligomers, an active cytoskeleton can facilitate fiber formation. This mechanical catalysis makes possible a positive feedback loop that would help localize the formation of CPEB fibers to active synapse areas and mark those synapses for forming a long-term memory after the prion form is established. The functional role of the CPEB helical oligomers in this mechanism carries with it implications for targeting such species in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>},

 abstract = {<p>We investigate the folding of GlpG, an intramembrane protease, using perfectly funneled structure-based models that implicitly account for the absence or presence of the membrane. These two models are used to describe, respectively, folding in detergent micelles and folding within a bilayer, which effectively constrains GlpG9s topology in unfolded and partially folded states. Structural free-energy landscape analysis shows that although the presence of multiple folding pathways is an intrinsic property of GlpG{\textquoteright}s modular functional architecture, the large entropic cost of organizing helical bundles in the absence of the constraining bilayer leads to pathways that backtrack (i.e., local unfolding of previously folded substructures is required when moving from the unfolded to the folded state along the minimum free-energy pathway). This backtracking explains the experimental observation of thermodynamically destabilizing mutations that accelerate GlpG{\textquoteright}s folding in detergent micelles. In contrast, backtracking is absent from the model when folding is constrained within a bilayer, the environment in which GlpG has evolved to fold. We also characterize a near-native state with a highly mobile transmembrane helix 5 (TM5) that is significantly populated under folding conditions when GlpG is embedded in a bilayer. Unbinding of TM5 from the rest of the structure exposes GlpG{\textquoteright}s active site, consistent with studies of the catalytic mechanism of GlpG that suggest that TM5 serves as a substrate gate to the active site.</p>},

In contrast to the na{\"\i}ve expectation based on stoichiometry, recent single-molecule studies have shown that the dissociation of Fis protein from DNA is accelerated by increasing the concentration of the Fis protein. Because the detailed molecular mechanism of facilitated dissociation is still not clear, in this study, we employ computational methods to explore the binding landscapes of Fis:DNA complexes with various stoichiometries. When two Fis molecules are present, simulations uncover a ternary complex, where the originally bound Fis protein is partially dissociated from DNA. The simulations support a three-state sequential kinetic model (N ⇄ I {\textrightarrow} D) for facilitated dissociation, thus explaining the concentration-dependent dissociation.},

 abstract = {<p>A predictive coarse-grained protein force field [associative memory, water-mediated, structure, and energy model for molecular dynamics (AWSEM)-MD] is used to study the energy landscapes and relative stabilities of amyloid-$\beta$ protein (1{\textendash}40) in the monomer and all of its oligomeric forms up to an octamer. We find that an isolated monomer is mainly disordered with a short $\alpha$-helix formed at the central hydrophobic core region (L17-D23). A less stable hairpin structure, however, becomes increasingly more stable in oligomers, where hydrogen bonds can form between neighboring monomers. We explore the structure and stability of both prefibrillar oligomers that consist of mainly antiparallel $\beta$-sheets and fibrillar oligomers with only parallel $\beta$-sheets. Prefibrillar oligomers are polymorphic but typically take on a cylindrin-like shape composed of mostly antiparallel $\beta$-strands. At the concentration of the simulation, the aggregation free energy landscape is nearly downhill. We use umbrella sampling along a structural progress coordinate for interconversion between prefibrillar and fibrillar forms to identify a conversion pathway between these forms. The fibrillar oligomer only becomes favored over its prefibrillar counterpart in the pentamer where an interconversion bottleneck appears. The structural characterization of the pathway along with statistical mechanical perturbation theory allow us to evaluate the effects of concentration on the free energy landscape of aggregation as well as the effects of the Dutch and Arctic mutations associated with early onset of Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease.</p>},

 abstract = {We recently proposed a model for I$\kappa$B$\alpha$-mediated molecular stripping of NF$\kappa$B from transcription sites. I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ was shown experimentally to form a transient ternary complex with DNA-bound NF$\kappa$B, but the mechanism by which the I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ accelerates dissociation of the NF$\kappa$B from the DNA was unknown. In this paper we construct and compute free energy profiles for the wild-type I$\kappa$B$\alpha$-mediated molecular stripping reaction of NF$\kappa$B from DNA and compare with that for a mutant of I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ bearing a charge-neutralized PEST. The differences in the free energy profile for stripping originate from the frustrated electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged PEST and the DNA. The PEST occupies two different conformations in the NF$\kappa$B{\textendash}I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ binary complex, one of which occupies the DNA-binding cavity. Specific interactions with positively charged residues in the N-terminal domains of both p50 and p65 apparently draw the domains closer together hindering reassociation of DNA. Comparison with the charge-neutralized mutant reveals that all of these functional consequences result from the negative charges in the PEST sequence of I$\kappa$B$\alpha$.},

 abstract = {<p>Huntington{\textquoteright}s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion in the polyglutamine (polyQ) track of the Huntingtin (HTT) protein. The severity of the disease depends on the polyQ repeat length, arising only in patients with proteins having 36 repeats or more. Previous studies have shown that the aggregation of N-terminal fragments (encoded by HTT exon 1) underlies the disease pathology in mouse models and that the HTT exon 1 gene product can self-assemble into amyloid structures. Here, we provide detailed structural mechanisms for aggregation of several protein fragments encoded by HTT exon 1 by using the associative memory, water-mediated, structure and energy model (AWSEM) to construct their free energy landscapes. We find that the addition of the N-terminal 17-residue sequence (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="i1" overflow="scroll"><mrow><mi>N</mi><msub><mi>T</mi><mn>17</mn></msub></mrow></math>) facilitates polyQ aggregation by encouraging the formation of prefibrillar oligomers, whereas adding the C-terminal polyproline sequence (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="i2" overflow="scroll"><msub><mi>P</mi><mn>10</mn></msub></math>) inhibits aggregation. The combination of both terminal additions in HTT exon 1 fragment leads to a complex aggregation mechanism with a basic core that resembles that found for the aggregation of pure polyQ repeats using AWSEM. At the extrapolated physiological concentration, although the grand canonical free energy profiles are uphill for HTT exon 1 fragments having 20 or 30 glutamines, the aggregation landscape for fragments with 40 repeats has become downhill. This computational prediction agrees with the critical length found for the onset of HD and suggests potential therapies based on blocking early binding events involving the terminal additions to the polyQ repeats.</p>},

@article{2017DiPierro:2017cba,
 abstract = {<p>Inside the cell nucleus, genomes fold into organized structures that are characteristic of cell type. Here, we show that this chromatin architecture can be predicted de novo using epigenetic data derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq). We exploit the idea that chromosomes encode a 1D sequence of chromatin structural types. Interactions between these chromatin types determine the 3D structural ensemble of chromosomes through a process similar to phase separation. First, a neural network is used to infer the relation between the epigenetic marks present at a locus, as assayed by ChIP-Seq, and the genomic compartment in which those loci reside, as measured by DNA-DNA proximity ligation (Hi-C). Next, types inferred from this neural network are used as an input to an energy landscape model for chromatin organization [Minimal Chromatin Model (MiChroM)] to generate an ensemble of 3D chromosome conformations at a resolution of 50 kilobases (kb). After training the model, dubbed Maximum Entropy Genomic Annotation from Biomarkers Associated to Structural Ensembles (MEGABASE), on odd-numbered chromosomes, we predict the sequences of chromatin types and the subsequent 3D conformational ensembles for the even chromosomes. We validate these structural ensembles by using ChIP-Seq tracks alone to predict Hi-C maps, as well as distances measured using 3D fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments. Both sets of experiments support the hypothesis of phase separation being the driving process behind compartmentalization. These findings strongly suggest that epigenetic marking patterns encode sufficient information to determine the global architecture of chromosomes and that de novo structure prediction for whole genomes may be increasingly possible.</p>},

 abstract = {The complex genetic programs of eukaryotic cells are often regulated by key transcription factors occupying or clearing out of a large number of genomic locations. Orchestrating the residence times of these factors is therefore important for the well organized functioning of a large network. The classic models of genetic switches sidestep this timing issue by assuming the binding of transcription factors to be governed entirely by thermodynamic protein-DNA affinities. Here we show that relying on passive thermodynamics and random release times can lead to a ``time-scale crisis'' for master genes that broadcast their signals to a large number of binding sites. We demonstrate that this time-scale crisis for clearance in a large broadcasting network can be resolved by actively regulating residence times through molecular stripping. We illustrate these ideas by studying a model of the stochastic dynamics of the genetic network of the central eukaryotic master regulator $\text{NF}\ensuremath{\kappa}\text{B}$ which broadcasts its signals to many downstream genes that regulate immune response, apoptosis, etc.},

 abstract = {Amyloids are fibrillar protein aggregates with simple repeated structural motifs in their cores, usually $\beta$-strands but sometimes $\alpha$-helices. Identifying the amyloid-prone regions within protein sequences is important both for understanding the mechanisms of amyloid-associated diseases and for understanding functional amyloids. Based on the crystal structures of seven cross-$\beta$ amyloidogenic peptides with different topologies and one recently solved cross-$\alpha$ fiber structure, we have developed a computational approach for identifying amyloidogenic segments in protein sequences using the Associative memory, Water mediated, Structure and Energy Model (AWSEM). The AWSEM-Amylometer performs favorably in comparison with other predictors in predicting aggregation-prone sequences in multiple data sets. The method also predicts well the specific topologies (the relative arrangement of $\beta$-strands in the core) of the amyloid fibrils. An important advantage of the AWSEM-Amylometer over other existing methods is its direct connection with an efficient, optimized protein folding simulation model, AWSEM. This connection allows one to combine efficient and accurate search of protein sequences for amyloidogenic segments with the detailed study of the thermodynamic and kinetic roles that these segments play in folding and aggregation in the context of the entire protein sequence. We present new simulation results that highlight the free energy landscapes of peptides that can take on multiple fibril topologies. We also demonstrate how the Amylometer methodology can be straightforwardly extended to the study of functional amyloids that have the recently discovered cross-$\alpha$ fibril architecture.},

 abstract = {<p>The heterogeneous elastoplastic deformation of structural glasses is explored using the framework of the random first-order transition theory of the glass transition along with an extended mode-coupling theory that includes activated events. The theory involves coupling the continuum elastic theory of strain transport with mobility generation and transport as described in the theory of glass aging and rejuvenation. Fluctuations that arise from the generation and transport of mobility, fictive temperature, and stress are treated explicitly. We examine the nonlinear flow of a glass under deformation at finite strain rate. The interplay among the fluctuating fields leads to the spatially heterogeneous dislocation of the particles in the glass, i.e., the appearance of shear bands of the type observed in metallic glasses deforming under mechanical stress.</p>},

 abstract = {Using a predictive coarse-grained protein force field, we compute and compare the free energy landscapes and relative stabilities of amyloid-$\beta$ protein (1{\textendash}42) and amyloid-$\beta$ protein (1{\textendash}40) in their monomeric and oligomeric forms up to the octamer. At the same concentration, the aggregation free energy profile of A$\beta$42 is more downhill, with a computed solubility that is about 10 times smaller than that of A$\beta$40. At a concentration of 40 $\mu$M, the clear free energy barrier between the pre-fibrillar tetramer form and the fibrillar pentamer in the A$\beta$40 aggregation landscape disappears for A$\beta$42, suggesting that the A$\beta$42 tetramer has a more diverse structural range. To further compare the landscapes, we develop a cluster analysis based on the structural similarity between configurations and use it to construct an oligomerization map that captures the paths of easy interconversion between different but structurally similar states of oligomers for both species. A taxonomy of the oligomer species based on $\beta$-sheet stacking topologies is proposed. The comparison of the two oligomerization maps highlights several key differences in the landscapes that can be attributed to the two additional C-terminal residues that A$\beta$40 lacks. In general, the two terminal residues strongly stabilize the oligomeric structures for A$\beta$42 relative to A$\beta$40, and greatly facilitate the conversion from pre-fibrillar trimers to fibrillar tetramers.},

 abstract = {<p>The nucleus of a eukaryotic cell is a nonequilibrium system where chromatin is subjected to active processes that continuously rearrange it over the cell{\textquoteright}s life cycle. Tracking the motion of chromosomal loci provides information about the organization of the genome and the physical processes shaping that organization. Optical experiments report that loci move with subdiffusive dynamics and that there is spatially coherent motion of the chromatin. We recently showed that it is possible to predict the 3D architecture of genomes through a physical model for chromosomes that accounts for the biochemical interactions mediated by proteins and regulated by epigenetic markers through a transferable energy landscape. Here, we study the temporal dynamics generated by this quasi-equilibrium energy landscape assuming Langevin dynamics at an effective temperature. Using molecular dynamics simulations of two interacting human chromosomes, we show that the very same interactions that account for genome architecture naturally reproduce the spatial coherence, viscoelasticity, and the subdiffusive behavior of the motion in interphase chromosomes as observed in numerous experiments. The agreement between theory and experiments suggests that even if active processes are involved, an effective quasi-equilibrium landscape model can largely mimic their dynamical effects.</p>},

 abstract = {When good structural templates can be identified, template-based modeling is the most reliable way to predict the tertiary structure of proteins. In this study, we combine template-based modeling with a realistic coarse-grained force field, AWSEM, that has been optimized using the principles of energy landscape theory. The Associative memory, Water mediated, Structure and Energy Model (AWSEM) is a coarse-grained force field having both transferable tertiary interactions and knowledge-based local-in-sequence interaction terms. We incorporate template information into AWSEM by introducing soft collective biases to the template structures, resulting in a model that we call AWSEM-Template. Structure prediction tests on eight targets, four of which are in the low sequence identity {\textquotedblleft}twilight zone{\textquotedblright} of homology modeling, show that AWSEM-Template can achieve high-resolution structure prediction. Our results also confirm that using a combination of AWSEM and a template-guided potential leads to more accurate prediction of protein structures than simply using a template-guided potential alone. Free energy profile analyses demonstrate that the soft collective biases to the template effectively increase funneling toward native-like structures while still allowing significant flexibility so as to allow for correction of discrepancies between the target structure and the template. A further stage of refinement using all-atom molecular dynamics augmented with soft collective biases to the structures predicted by AWSEM-Template leads to a further improvement of both backbone and side-chain accuracy by maintaining sufficient flexibility but at the same time discouraging unproductive unfolding events often seen in unrestrained all-atom refinement simulations. The all-atom refinement simulations also reduce patches of frustration of the initial predictions. Some of the backbones found among the structures produced during the initial coarse-grained prediction step already have CE-RMSD values of less than 3 {\AA} with 90% or more of the residues aligned to the experimentally solved structure for all targets. All-atom structures generated during the following all-atom refinement simulations, which started from coarse-grained structures that were chosen without reference to any knowledge about the native structure, have CE-RMSD values of less than 2.5 {\AA} with 90% or more of the residues aligned for 6 out of 8 targets. Clustering low energy structures generated during the initial coarse-grained annealing picks out reliably structures that are within 1 {\AA} of the best sampled structures in 5 out of 8 cases. After the all-atom refinement, structures that are within 1 {\AA} of the best sampled structures can be selected using a simple algorithm based on energetic features alone in 7 out of 8 cases.},

 abstract = {<p>Refining predicted protein structures with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations is one route to producing, entirely by computational means, structural models of proteins that rival in quality those that are determined by X-ray diffraction experiments. Slow rearrangements within the compact folded state, however, make routine refinement of predicted structures by unrestrained simulations infeasible. In this work, we draw inspiration from the fields of metallurgy and blacksmithing, where practitioners have worked out practical means of controlling equilibration by mechanically deforming their samples. We describe a two-step refinement procedure that involves identifying collective variables for mechanical deformations using a coarse-grained model and then sampling along these deformation modes in all-atom simulations. Identifying those low-frequency collective modes that change the contact map the most proves to be an effective strategy for choosing which deformations to use for sampling. The method is tested on 20 refinement targets from the CASP12 competition and is found to induce large structural rearrangements that drive the structures closer to the experimentally determined structures during relatively short all-atom simulations of 50 ns. By examining the accuracy of side-chain rotamer states in subensembles of structures that have varying degrees of similarity to the experimental structure, we identified the reorientation of aromatic side chains as a step that remains slow even when encouraging global mechanical deformations in the all-atom simulations. Reducing the side-chain rotamer isomerization barriers in the all-atom force field is found to further speed up refinement.</p>},

 abstract = {The problems of protein folding and protein design are two sides of the same coin. Protein folding involves exploring a protein{\textquoteright}s configuration space given a fixed sequence, whereas protein design involves searching in sequence space given a particular target structure. For a protein to fold quickly and reliably, its energy landscape must be biased toward the folded ensemble throughout its configuration space and must lack deep kinetic traps that would otherwise frustrate folding. Evolution has {\textquotedblleft}designed{\textquotedblright} the sequences of many naturally occurring proteins, through an eons-long process of random mutation and selection, to yield landscapes with a minimal degree of frustration. The task facing humans hoping to design protein sequences that fold into particular structures is to use the available approximate energy functions to sculpt funneled landscapes that work in the laboratory. In this work, we demonstrate how to calculate several localized frustration measures using an all-atom energy function. Specifically, we employ the Rosetta energy function, which has been used successfully to design proteins and which has a natural pairwise decomposition that is suitably solvent-averaged. We calculate these newly developed frustration measures for both a mutated WW domain, FiP35, and a three-helix bundle that was designed completely by humans, Alpha3D. The structure of FiP35 exhibits less localized frustration than that of Alpha3D. A mutation toward the consensus sequence for WW domains in FiP35, which has been shown unexpectedly in experiment to disrupt folding, induces localized frustration by disrupting the hydrophobic core. By performing a limited redesign on the sequence of Alpha3D, we show that some, but not all, mutations that lower the energy also result in decreased frustration. The results suggest that, in addition to being useful for detecting residual frustration in protein structures, optimizing the localized frustration measures presented here may be a useful and automatic means of balancing positive and negative design in protein design tasks.},

Overall, strong energetic conflicts are minimized in folded native states according to the principle of minimal frustration, so that a sequence can spontaneously fold, but local violations of this principle open up the possibility to encode the complex energy landscapes that are required for active biological functions. We survey the local energetic frustration patterns of all protein enzymes with known structures and experimentally annotated catalytic residues. In agreement with previous hypotheses, the catalytic sites themselves are often highly frustrated regardless of the protein oligomeric state, overall topology, and enzymatic class. At the same time a secondary shell of more weakly frustrated interactions surrounds the catalytic site itself. We evaluate the conservation of these energetic signatures in various family members of major enzyme classes, showing that local frustration is evolutionarily more conserved than the primary structure itself.</p>},

Here, we monitor the growth of individual A$\beta$40 fibrils by time-resolved in situ atomic force microscopy and thereby directly measure fibril growth rates. The measured growth rates in a population of fibrils that includes both single protofilaments and bundles of filaments are independent of the fibril thickness, indicating that cooperation between adjacent protofilaments does not affect incorporation of monomers. The opposite ends of individual fibrils grow at similar rates. In contrast to the {\textquotedblleft}stop-and-go{\textquotedblright} kinetics that has previously been observed for amyloid-forming peptides, growth and dissolution of the A$\beta$40 fibrils are relatively steady for peptide concentration of 0{\textendash}10 $\mu$M. The fibrils readily dissolve in quiescent peptide-free solutions at a rate that is consistent with the microscopic reversibility of growth and dissolution. Importantly, the bimolecular rate coefficient for the association of a monomer to the fibril end is significantly smaller than the diffusion limit, implying that the transition state for incorporation of a monomer into a fibril is associated with a relatively high free energy.},

 abstract = {<p>Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) plays a key role in the plasticity of dendritic spines. Calcium signals cause calcium{\textminus}calmodulin to activate CaMKII, which leads to remodeling of the actin filament (F-actin) network in the spine. We elucidate the mechanism of the remodeling by combining computer simulations with protein array experiments and electron microscopic imaging, to arrive at a structural model for the dodecameric complex of CaMKII with F-actin. The binding interface involves multiple domains of CaMKII. This structure explains the architecture of the micrometer-scale CaMKII/F-actin bundles arising from the multivalence of CaMKII. We also show that the regulatory domain of CaMKII may bind either calmodulin or F-actin, but not both. This frustration, along with the multipartite nature of the binding interface, allows calmodulin transiently to strip CaMKII from actin assemblies so that they can reorganize. This observation therefore provides a simple mechanism by which the structural dynamics of CaMKII establishes the link between calcium signaling and the morphological plasticity of dendritic spines.</p>},

 abstract = {As a master transcription regulator, the Fis protein influences over two hundred genes of E. coli. The Fis protein{\textquoteright}s nonspecific binding to DNA is widely acknowledged, and its kinetics of dissociation from DNA is strongly influenced by its surroundings: the dissociation rate increases as the concentration of the Fis protein in the solution phase increases. In this study, we use computational methods to explore the global binding energy landscape of the Fis1:Fis2:DNA ternary complex. The complex contains a binary{\textendash}Fis molecular dyad whose formation relies on complex structural rearrangements. The simulations allow us to distinguish several different pathways for the dissociation of the protein from DNA with different functional outcomes and involving different protein stoichiometries: (1) simple exchange of proteins and (2) cooperative unbinding of two Fis proteins to yield bare DNA. In the case of exchange, the protein on the DNA is replaced by the solution-phase protein through competition for DNA binding sites. This process seen in fluorescence imaging experiments has been called facilitated dissociation. In the latter case of cooperative unbinding of pairs, two neighboring Fis proteins on DNA form a unique binary{\textendash}Fis configuration via protein{\textendash}protein interactions, which in turn leads to the codissociation of both molecules simultaneously, a process akin to the {\textquotedblleft}molecular stripping{\textquotedblright} seen in the NF$\kappa$B/I$\kappa$B genetic broadcasting system. This simulation shows that the existence of multiple binding configurations of transcription factors can have a significant impact on the kinetics and outcome of transcription factor dissociation from DNA, with important implications for the systems biology of gene regulation by Fis.},

 abstract = {<p>Assemblies of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins and kleisin subunits are essential to chromosome organization and segregation across all kingdoms of life. While structural data exist for parts of the SMC{\textminus}kleisin complexes, complete structures of the entire complexes have yet to be determined, making mechanistic studies difficult. Using an integrative approach that combines crystallographic structural information about the globular subdomains, along with coevolutionary information and an energy landscape optimized force field (AWSEM), we predict atomic-scale structures for several tripartite SMC{\textminus}kleisin complexes, including prokaryotic condensin, eukaryotic cohesin, and eukaryotic condensin. The molecular dynamics simulations of the SMC{\textminus}kleisin protein complexes suggest that these complexes exist as a broad conformational ensemble that is made up of different topological isomers. The simulations suggest a critical role for the SMC coiled-coil regions, where the coils intertwine with various linking numbers. The twist and writhe of these braided coils are coupled with the motion of the SMC head domains, suggesting that the complexes may function as topological motors. Opening, closing, and translation along the DNA of the SMC{\textminus}kleisin protein complexes would allow these motors to couple to the topology of DNA when DNA is entwined with the braided coils.</p>},

 abstract = {Recently several techniques have emerged that significantly enhance the quality of predictions of protein tertiary structures. In this study, we describe the performance of AWSEM-Suite, an algorithm that incorporates template-based modeling and coevolutionary restraints with a realistic coarse-grained force field, AWSEM. With its roots in neural networks, AWSEM contains both physical and bioinformatical energies that have been optimized using energy landscape theory. AWSEM-Suite participated in CASP13 as a server predictor and generated reliable predictions for most targets. AWSEM-Suite ranked eighth in both the free-modeling category and the hard-to-model category and in one case provided the best submitted prediction. Here we critically discuss the prediction performance of AWSEM-Suite using several examples from different categories in CASP13. Structure prediction tests on these selected targets, two of them being hard-to-model targets, show that AWSEM-Suite can achieve high-resolution structure prediction after incorporating both template guidances and coevolutionary restraints even when homology is weak. For targets with reliable templates (template-easy category), introducing coevolutionary restraints sometimes damages the overall quality of the predictions. Free energy profile analyses demonstrate, however, that the incorporations of both of these evolutionarily informed terms effectively increase the funneling of the landscape toward native-like structures while still allowing sufficient flexibility to correct for discrepancies between the correct target structure and the provided guidance. In contrast to other predictors that are exclusively oriented toward structure prediction, the connection of AWSEM-Suite to a statistical mechanical basis and affiliated molecular dynamics and importance sampling simulations makes it suitable for functional explorations.},

The model underlying the server’s predictions is a coarse-grained protein force field which has its roots in neural network ideas that has been optimized using energy landscape theory. Employing physically motivated potentials and knowledge-based local structure biasing terms, the addition of homologous template and co-evolutionary restraints to AWSEM-Suite greatly improves the predictive power of pure AWSEM structure prediction.

 abstract = {<p>Filaments made up of different isoforms of tau protein are associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Filaments made up of the 4R-tau isoform, which has four repeat regions (R1 to R4), are found in patients suffering from Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease, while filaments made of the 3R-tau isoform, which contains only three repeat units (R1, R3, and R4), are found in patients with Pick{\textquoteright}s disease (frontotemporal dementia). In this work, a predictive coarse-grained protein force field, the associative memory water-mediated structure and energy model (AWSEM), is used to study the energy landscapes of nucleation of the two different fibrils derived from patients with Pick{\textquoteright}s and Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s diseases. The landscapes for nucleating both fibril types contain amorphous oligomers leading to branched structures as well as prefibrillar oligomers. These two classes of oligomers differ in their structural details: The prefibrillar oligomers have more parallel in-register $\beta$-strands, which ultimately lead to amyloid fibrils, while the amorphous oligomers are characterized by a near random $\beta$-strand stacking, leading to a distinct amorphous phase. The landscape topography suggests that there must be significant structural reordering, or {\textquotedblleft}backtracking,{\textquotedblright} to transit from the amorphous aggregation channel to the fibrillization channel. Statistical mechanical perturbation theory allows us to evaluate the effects of changing concentration on the aggregation free-energy landscapes and to predict the effects of phosphorylation, which is known to facilitate the aggregation of tau repeats.</p>},

 abstract = {We present a theoretical analysis of the dynamic structure factor (DSF) of a liquid at and below the mode coupling critical temperature $T_c$, by developing a self-consistent theoretical treatment which includes the contributions both from continuous diffusion, described using general two coupling parameter ($F_{12}$) mode coupling theory (MCT), and from the activated hopping, described using the random first order transition (RFOT) theory, incorporating the effect of dynamical heterogeneity. The theory is valid over the whole temperature plane and shows correct limiting MCT like behavior above $T_{c}$ and goes over to the RFOT theory near the glass transition temperature, $T_{g}$. Between $T_{c}$ and $T_{g}$, the theory predicts that neither the continuous diffusion, described by pure mode coupling theory, nor the hopping motion alone suffices but both contribute to the dynamics while interacting with each other. We show that the interplay between the two contributions conspires to modify the relaxation behavior of the DSF from what would be predicted by a theory with a complete static Gaussian barrier distribution in a manner that may be described as a facilitation effect. Close to $T_c$, coupling between the short time part of MCT dynamics and hopping reduces the stretching given by the F$_{12}$-MCT theory significantly and accelerates structural relaxation. As the temperature is progressively lowered below $T_c$, the equations yield a crossover from MCT dominated regime to the hopping dominated regime. In the combined theory the dynamical heterogeneity is modified because the low barrier components interact with the MCT dynamics to enhance the relaxation rate below $T_c$ and reduces the stretching that would otherwise arise from an input static barrier height distribution. <P />},

 abstract = {A unified treatment of structural relaxation in a deeply supercooled glassy liquid is developed which extends the existing mode coupling theory (MCT) by incorporating the effects of activated events by using the concepts from the random first order transition (RFOT) theory. We show how the decay of the dynamic structure factor is modified by localized activated events (called instantons) which lead to the spatial reorganization of molecules in the region where the instanton pops up. The instanton vertex added to the usual MCT depicts the probability and consequences of such an event which can be derived from the random first order transition theory. The vertex is proportional to $exp(-A/s_{c})$ where $s_{c}$ is the configurational entropy. Close to the glass transition temperature, $T_{g}$, since $s_{c}$ is diminishing, the activated process slows beyond the time window and this eventually leads to an arrest of the structural relaxation as expected for glasses. The combined treatment describes the dynamic structure factor in deeply supercooled liquid fairly well, with a hopping dominated decay following the MCT plateau. <P />},

 abstract = {Chromatin consists of DNA and hundreds of proteins that interact with the genetic material. In vivo, chromatin folds into nonrandom structures. The physical mechanism leading to these characteristic conformations, however, remains poorly understood. We recently introduced MiChroM, a model that generates chromosome conformations by using the idea that chromatin can be subdivided into types based on its biochemical interactions. Here we extend and complete our previous finding by showing that structural chromatin types can be inferred from ChIP-Seq data. Chromatin types, which are distinct from DNA sequence, are partially epigenetically controlled and change during cell differentiation, thus constituting a link between epigenetics, chromosomal organization, and cell development. We show that, for GM12878 lymphoblastoid cells we are able to predict accurate chromosome structures with the only input of genomic data. The degree of accuracy achieved by our prediction supports the viability of the proposed physical mechanism of chromatin folding and makes the computational model a powerful tool for future investigations. <P />},

We examined changes in protein conformation under external force fields by simple theoretical methods and new simulation techniques. The theoretical model solved a Gaussian chain plus native contact residue-level model under approximations. The simulations used the force ensemble replica exchange method and all-atom stochastic dynamics with a generalized Born plus solvent accessible surface as the solvation model. We applied these methods to study the protein spectrin as well as the domains of titin. Both global properties (such as energy and extension) and local roperties (especially, the specific contacts maintained and the secondary structure) are shown as functions of external force. <P />},

We numerically solve the continuum equations of mobility and temperature fields and find that the fluctuations which account for spatiotemporal structure in aging and rejuvenating glasses lead for dynamical heterogeneity in glass. Non-Gaussian distribution of free energy, stretch exponent $\beta$, and growing characteristic length are presented along with the four-point correlation function. Our results demonstrate that two equilibration mechanisms that have been observed in aged polymer glasses are the results of the heterogeneity and out-of-equilibrium behavior of glasses below the glass transition temperature. Numerical results of distribution of relaxation time agree with experimental observations. <P />},

@article{Wolynes:tj,
 abstract = {To understand many problems in modern science one must cope with a diversity of long-lived states or attractors. The necessary notion is that of an energy landscape. Cluster physics, protein dynamics and protein folding are key examples of problems where a landscape description is essential. In bulk condensed matter e.g. supercooled liquids and glasses, a landscape can only be meaningfully assigned to a small region of the system. Such local landscapes, however, can be constructed and used to describe the unusual slowing as the glass transition is approached and aging phenomena in quenched glasses. The resulting theory is quantitatively successful. Fully quantum glasses may also exist. Far-from equilibrium systems, such as cytoskeleton and gene networks require going beyond the landscape notion in new ways, which we will briefly describe. <P />},
